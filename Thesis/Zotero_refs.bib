	abstract = {Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are non-coding DNA regions involved in the spatio-temporal regulation of gene expression. Gene regulatory changes drive animal development and play major roles during evolution of animal body plans. Therefore, we believe that determining CREs at different developmental stages and across animal lineages is critical to understand how evolution operates through development. The Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin followed by high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) is a powerful technique for the study of CREs that takes advantage of Tn5 transposase activity. Starting from fewer than 105 cells, in a 1-day procedure, it is possible to detect, at a genome-wide level, CREs located in open chromatin regions with high resolution. Here, we describe a detailed step-by-step ATAC-seq protocol for invertebrate chordate marine embryos. We have successfully applied this technique to amphioxus and two species of tunicate embryos. We also show an easy workflow to analyze data generated with this technique. Moreover, we point out that this method and our bioinformatic pipeline are efficient to detect CREs associated with Wnt signaling pathway by simply using embryos treated with a drug that perturbs this pathway. This approach can be extended to other signaling pathways and also to embryo mutants for critical genes. Our results therefore demonstrate the power of ATAC-seq for the identification of CREs that play essential functions during animal development in a wide range of invertebrate or vertebrate animals.},

	abstract = {The family of Hox-proteins has been a major focus of research for over 30 years. Hox-proteins are crucial to the correct development of bilateral organisms, however, some uncertainty remains as to which Hox-proteins are functionally equivalent across different species. Initial classification of Hox-proteins was based on phylogenetic analysis of the 60 amino acid homeodomain. This approach was successful in classifying Hox-proteins with differing homeodomains, but the relationships of Hox-proteins with nearly identical homeodomains, yet distinct biological functions, could not be resolved. Correspondingly, these ‘problematic’ proteins were classified into one large unresolved group. Other classifications used the relative location of the Hox-protein coding genes on the chromosome (synteny) to further resolve this group. Although widely used, this synteny-based classification is inconsistent with experimental evidence from functional equivalence studies. These inconsistencies led us to re-examine and derive a new classification for the Hox-protein family using all Hox-protein sequences available in the GenBank non-redundant protein database (NCBI-nr). We compare the use of the homeodomain, the homeodomain with conserved flanking regions (the YPWM and linker region), and full length Hox-protein sequences as a basis for classification of Hox-proteins. In contrast to previous attempts, our approach is able to resolve the relationships for the ‘problematic’ as well as ABD-B-like Hox-proteins. We highlight differences to previous classifications and clarify the relationships of Hox-proteins across the five major model organisms, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Branchiostoma floridae, Mus musculus and Danio rerio. Comparative and functional analysis of Hox-proteins, two fields crucial to understanding the development of bilateral organisms, have been hampered by difficulties in predicting functionally equivalent Hox-proteins across species. Our classification scheme offers a higher-resolution classification that is in accordance with phylogenetic as well as experimental data and, thereby, provides a novel basis for experiments, such as comparative and functional analyses of Hox-proteins.},

Despite their conserved expression patterns, it is currently unclear to which extent Vsx functions are also conserved across vertebrates, as mutant models are available only in mammals. To gain insight into vsx function in teleosts, we have generated vsx1 and vsx2 CRISPR/Cas9 double knockouts (vsxKO) in zebrafish. Our electrophysiological and histological analyses indicate severe visual impairment and bipolar cells depletion in vsxKO larvae, with retinal precursors being rerouted toward photoreceptor or Müller glia fates. Surprisingly, neural retina is properly specified and maintained in mutant embryos, which do not display microphthalmia. We show that although important cis-regulatory remodelling occurs in vsxKO retinas during early specification, this has little impact at a transcriptomic level. Our observations point to genetic redundancy as an important mechanism sustaining the integrity of the retinal specification network, and to Vsx genes regulatory weight varying substantially among vertebrate species.},

Here, we used a unique vertebrate model, Astyanax mexicanus—different morphotypes of which survive in nutrient-rich surface and nutrient-deprived cave waters—to uncover gene regulatory networks underlying metabolic adaptation. We performed genome-wide epigenetic profiling in the liver tissues of Astyanax and found that many of the identified cis-regulatory elements (CREs) have genetically diverged and have differential chromatin features between surface and cave morphotypes, while retaining remarkably similar regulatory signatures between independently derived cave populations. One such CRE in the hpdb gene harbors a genomic deletion in cavefish that abolishes IRF2 repressor binding and derepresses enhancer activity in reporter assays. Selection of this mutation in multiple independent cave populations supports its importance in cave adaptation, and provides novel molecular insights into the evolutionary trade-off between loss of pigmentation and adaptation to food-deprived caves.},

	abstract = {Cavefish populations of Astyanax mexicanus have increased body fat compared to surface fish populations of the same species when fed ad libitum in the laboratory. We have previously shown that some cavefish populations display hyperphagia (elevated appetite) to increase food consumption, fat deposition and starvation resistance. However, not all cavefish populations display hyperphagia, yet all previously tested cavefish display elevated body fat levels. Here we have extended this analysis by focusing on visceral fat acquisition in three independently derived cavefish populations. We show that cavefish from two independently derived cavefish populations (Pachón and Tinaja) display increased amounts of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) due to hypertrophy of visceral adipocytes while Molino cavefish display hypertrophy but only slightly elevated VAT levels compared to surface fish. Furthermore, we show that Pachón and Tinaja cavefish develop increased VAT even when food intake is matched to surface fish, suggesting appetite independent mechanisms. We show that in the Pachón population, the differences in the visceral fat in adults correlates with changes in the timing of visceral development, making a developmental contribution likely. Visceral fat development in surface fish starts between 10 and 11 dpf, while in Pachón cavefish, visceral fat cells become visible as early as 8 dpf and develop significantly higher amounts of lipid droplets before surface fish start visceral fat accumulation. We further show that this developmental difference is unique to the Pachón cavefish population, while the Tinaja cavefish population - which displays hyperphagia - starts to develop visceral fat similar to surface fish. We suggest the differences in early adipogenesis in the Pachón population as an additional strategy of increased fat gain in cavefish to adapt to food scarcity.},

Molecularly, the presumptive RPE can be identified by the early expression of two transcription factors, \textit{Mitf} and \textit{Otx.} In mice deficient for either gene, RPE development is impaired with loss of melanogenic gene expression, raising the possibility that in the eye OTX proteins operate either in a feedback loop or in cooperation with MITF for the control of RPE-specific gene expression. Here we show that \textit{Otx2} induces a pigmented phenotype when overexpressed in avian neural retina cells. In addition, OTX2 binds specifically to a bicoid motif present in the promoter regions of three Mitf target genes, QNR71, TRP-1, and tyrosinase, leading to their transactivation. OTX2 and MITF co-localize in the nuclei of RPE cells and physically interact, and their co-expression results in a cooperative activation of QNR71 and tyrosinase promoters. Collectively, these data suggest that both transcription factors operate at the same hierarchical level to establish the identity of the RPE.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We hypothesized that shadow enhancers drive consistent expression levels by buffering upstream noise through a separation of transcription factor (TF) inputs at the individual enhancers. By measuring the transcriptional dynamics of several Kruppel shadow enhancer configurations in live Drosophila embryos, we showed that individual member enhancers act largely independently. We found that TF fluctuations are an appreciable source of noise that the shadow enhancer pair can better buffer than duplicated enhancers. The shadow enhancer pair is also uniquely able to maintain low levels of expression noise across a wide range of temperatures. A stochastic model demonstrated the separation of TF inputs is sufficient to explain these findings. Our results suggest the widespread use of shadow enhancers is partially due to their noise suppressing ability.},

	abstract = {Enhancers are often studied as noncoding regulatory elements that modulate the precise spatiotemporal expression of genes in a highly tissue-specific manner. This paradigm has been challenged by recent evidence of individual enhancers acting in multiple tissues or developmental contexts. However, the frequency of these enhancers with high degrees of “pleiotropy” out of all putative enhancers is not well understood. Consequently, it is unclear how the variation of enhancer pleiotropy corresponds to the variation in expression breadth of target genes. Here, we use multi-tissue chromatin maps from diverse human tissues to investigate the enhancer–gene interaction architecture while accounting for 1) the distribution of enhancer pleiotropy, 2) the variations of regulatory links from enhancers to target genes, and 3) the expression breadth of target genes. We show that most enhancers are tissue-specific and that highly pleiotropy enhancers account for \&lt;1\% of all putative regulatory sequences in the human genome. Notably, several genomic features are indicative of increasing enhancer pleiotropy, including longer sequence length, greater number of links to genes, increasing abundance and diversity of encoded transcription factor motifs, and stronger evolutionary conservation. Intriguingly, the number of enhancers per gene remains remarkably consistent for all genes (∼14). However, enhancer pleiotropy does not directly translate to the expression breadth of target genes. We further present a series of Gaussian Mixture Models to represent this organization architecture. Consequently, we demonstrate that a modest trend of more pleiotropic enhancers targeting more broadly expressed genes can generate the observed diversity of expression breadths in the human genome.},

We generate tp63-knock-out mutants that recapitulate human phenotypes and show down-regulated epidermal gene expression. Following p63-binding dynamics, we find two distinct functions clearly separated in space and time. During early development, p63 binds enhancers associated to neural genes, limiting Sox3 binding and reducing neural gene expression. Indeed, we show that p63 and Sox3 are co-expressed in the neural plate border. On the other hand, p63 acts as a pioneer factor by binding non-accessible chromatin at epidermal enhancers, promoting their opening and epidermal gene expression in later developmental stages. Therefore, our results suggest that p63 regulates cell fate decisions during vertebrate ectoderm specification.},

Using chromosome conformation capture, we show that enhancer sharing is widespread within the cluster, explaining its evolutionarily conserved organization. We also identify a three-dimensional architecture, probably formed through interactions with CCCTC-binding factor, which is present within both Irx clusters of mouse, Xenopus and zebrafish. This architecture brings the promoters of the first two genes together in the same chromatin landscape.

While the vertebrate head mesoderm is unsegmented, the paraxial mesoderm of the earliest divergent chordate clade, the cephalochordates (amphioxus), is fully segmented in somites. We have previously shown that fibroblast growth factor signalling controls the formation of the most anterior somites in amphioxus; therefore, unravelling the fibroblast growth factor signalling downstream effectors is of crucial importance to shed light on the evolutionary origin of vertebrate head muscles. By using a comparative RNA sequencing approach and genetic functional analyses, we show that several transcription factors, such as Six1/2, Pax3/7 and Zic, act in combination to ensure the formation of three different somite populations. Interestingly, these proteins are orthologous to key regulators of trunk, and not head, muscle formation in vertebrates. Contrary to prevailing thinking, our results suggest that the vertebrate head mesoderm is of visceral and not paraxial origin and support a multistep evolutionary scenario for the appearance of the unsegmented mesoderm of the vertebrates new ‘head’.},

	abstract = {The neural crest is a vertebrate-specific embryonic stem cell population that gives rise to a vast array of cell types throughout the animal body plan. These cells are first born at the edges of the central nervous system, from which they migrate extensively and differentiate into multiple cellular derivatives. Given the unique set of structures these cells comprise, the origin of the neural crest is thought to have important implications for the evolution and diversification of the vertebrate clade. In jawed vertebrates, neural crest cells exist as distinct subpopulations along the anterior-posterior axis. These subpopulations differ in terms of their respective differentiation potential and cellular derivatives. Thus, the modern neural crest is characterized as multipotent, migratory, and regionally segregated throughout the embryo. Here, we retrace the evolutionary origins of the neural crest, from the appearance of conserved regulatory circuitry in basal chordates to the emergence of neural crest subpopulations in higher vertebrates. Finally, we discuss a stepwise trajectory by which these cells may have arisen and diversified throughout vertebrate evolution.},

We infer major genomic patterns associated with the variety of animal forms from the superphylum to phylum level. We show that a remarkable amount of gene loss occurred during the evolution of two major groups of bilaterian animals, Ecdysozoa and Deuterostomia, and further loss in several deuterostome lineages. Deuterostomes and protostomes also show large genome novelties. At the phylum level, flatworms, nematodes and tardigrades show the largest reduction of gene complement, alongside gene novelty. These findings paint a picture of evolution in the animal kingdom in which reductive evolution at the protein-coding level played a major role in shaping genome composition.},

Wnt target expression around the blastopore falls into two main categories: a horseshoe shape with a dorsal gap, as in Wnt8 expression; or a ring, as in FGF8 expression. Using ChIP-seq, we show, surprisingly, that the FGF signaling mediator Ets2 binds near all Wnt target genes. However, β-catenin preferentially binds at the promoters of genes with horseshoe patterns, but further from the promoters of genes with ring patterns. Manipulation of FGF or Wnt signaling demonstrated that ‘ring’ genes are responsive to FGF signaling at the dorsal midline, whereas ‘horseshoe’ genes are predominantly regulated by Wnt signaling. We suggest that, in the absence of active β-catenin at the dorsal midline, the DNA-binding protein TCF binds and actively represses gene activity only when close to the promoter. In contrast, genes without functional TCF sites at the promoter may be predominantly regulated by Ets at the dorsal midline and are expressed in a ring. These results suggest recruitment of only short-range repressors to potential Wnt targets in the Xenopus gastrula.},

	abstract = {In order to generate the tissues and organs of a multicellular organism, different cell types have to be generated during embryonic development. The first step in this process of cellular diversification is the formation of the three germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. The ectoderm gives rise to the nervous system, epidermis and various neural crest-derived tissues, the endoderm goes on to form the gastrointestinal, respiratory and urinary systems as well as many endocrine glands, and the mesoderm will form the notochord, axial skeleton, cartilage, connective tissue, trunk muscles, kidneys and blood. Classic experiments in amphibian embryos revealed the tissue interactions involved in germ layer formation and provided the groundwork for the identification of secreted and intracellular factors involved in this process. We will begin this review by summarising the key findings of those studies. We will then evaluate them in the light of more recent genetic studies that helped clarify which of the previously identified factors are required for germ layer formation in vivo, and to what extent the mechanisms identified in amphibians are conserved across other vertebrate species. Collectively, these studies have started to reveal the gene regulatory network (GRN) underlying vertebrate germ layer specification and we will conclude our review by providing examples how our understanding of this GRN can be employed to differentiate stem cells in a targeted fashion for therapeutic purposes.},

	abstract = {Irx7, a member in the zebrafish iroquois transcription factor (TF) family, has been shown to control brain patterning. During retinal development, irx7's expression was found to appear exclusively in the inner nuclear layer (INL) as soon as the prospective INL cells withdraw from the cell cycle and during retinal lamination. In Irx7-deficient retinas, the formation of a proper retinal lamination was disrupted and the differentiation of INL cell types, including amacrine, horizontal, bipolar and Muller cells, was compromised. Despite irx7's exclusive expression in the INL, photoreceptors differentiation was also compromised in Irx7-deficient retinas. Compared with other retinal cell types, ganglion cells differentiated relatively well in these retinas, except for their dendritic projections into the inner plexiform layer (IPL). In fact, the neuronal projections of amacrine and bipolar cells into the IPL were also diminished. These indicate that the retinal lamination issue in the Irx7-deficient retinas is likely caused by the attenuation of the neurite outgrowth. Since the expression of known TFs that can specify specific retinal cell type was also altered in Irx7-deficient retinas, thus the irx7 gene network is possibly a novel regulatory circuit for retinal development and lamination.},

	abstract = {The cavefish morph of the Mexican tetra (Astyanax mexicanus) is blind at adult stage, although an eye that includes a retina and a lens develops during embryogenesis. There are, however, two major defects in cavefish eye development. One is lens apoptosis, a phenomenon that is indirectly linked to the expansion of ventral midline sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression during gastrulation and that induces eye degeneration. The other is the lack of the ventral quadrant of the retina. Here, we show that such ventralisation is not extended to the entire forebrain because fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8), which is expressed in the forebrain rostral signalling centre, is activated 2 hours earlier in cavefish embryos than in their surface fish counterparts, in response to stronger Shh signalling in cavefish. We also show that neural plate patterning and morphogenesis are modified in cavefish, as assessed by Lhx2 and Lhx9 expression. Inhibition of Fgf receptor signalling in cavefish with SU5402 during gastrulation/early neurulation mimics the typical surface fish phenotype for both Shh and Lhx2/9 gene expression. Fate-mapping experiments show that posterior medial cells of the anterior neural plate, which lack Lhx2 expression in cavefish, contribute to the ventral quadrant of the retina in surface fish, whereas they contribute to the hypothalamus in cavefish. Furthermore, when Lhx2 expression is rescued in cavefish after SU5402 treatment, the ventral quadrant of the retina is also rescued. We propose that increased Shh signalling in cavefish causes earlier Fgf8 expression, a crucial heterochrony that is responsible for Lhx2 expression and retina morphogenesis defect.},

Cave environments present such a challenge and obligate cave animals have adapted to perpetual darkness by evolving a multitude of traits. The most common and most studied cave characteristics are the regression of eyes and the overall reduction in pigmentation. Studying these traits can provide important insights into how evolutionary forces drive convergent and regressive adaptation. The blind Mexican cavefish (Astyanax mexicanus) has emerged as a useful model to study cave evolution owing to the availability of genetic and genomic resources, and the amenability of embryonic development as the different populations remain fertile with each other. In this review, we give an overview of our current knowledge underlying the process of regressive and convergent evolution using eye degeneration in cavefish as an example.

In constant darkness surface forms exhibited a circadian rhythm in metabolism with an increase in oxygen demand during the subjective daytime, whereas cave forms did not. The lack of circadian rhythm in metabolism leads to a 27\% energy savings for Pachón cave fish compared to surface fish when comparing both forms in their natural photoperiods. When surface forms were tested under constant dark conditions they expended 38\% more energy than cave forms under equivalent conditions. Elimination of the circadian rhythm in metabolism may be a general feature of animals that live in perpetually dark food-limited environments such as caves or the deep sea.},

Here we use whole genome resequencing in the Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, to investigate how selection has shaped the repeated evolution of both trait loss and enhancement across independent cavefish lineages. We show that selection on standing genetic variation and de novo mutations both contribute substantially to repeated adaptation. Our findings provide empirical support for the hypothesis that genes with larger mutational targets are more likely to be the substrate of repeated evolution and indicate that features of the cave environment may impact the rate at which mutations occur.},

The 2R Hypothesis suggests that two WGD events (1R and 2R) occurred during early vertebrate evolution2, 3. However, the veracity and timing of the 2R event relative to the divergence of gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates) and cyclostomes (jawless hagfishes and lampreys) is unresolved4–6 and whether these WGD events underlie vertebrate phenotypic diversification remains elusive7. Here we present the genome of the inshore hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri. Through comparative analysis with lamprey and gnathostome genomes, we reconstruct the early events in cyclostome genome evolution, leveraging insights into the ancestral vertebrate genome. Genome-wide synteny and phylogenetic analyses support a scenario in which 1R occurred in the vertebrate stem-lineage during the early Cambrian, and the 2R event occurred in the gnathostome stem-lineage in the late Cambrian after its divergence from cyclostomes. We find that the genome of stem-cyclostomes experienced two additional, independent genome duplications (herein CR1 and CR2). Functional genomic and morphospace analyses demonstrate that WGD events generally contribute to developmental evolution with similar changes in the regulatory genome of both vertebrate groups. However, appreciable morphological diversification occurred only after the 2R event, questioning the general expectation that WGDs lead to leaps of morphological complexity7.},

However, it remains unknown whether Clock directly cross-talks with Nodal signaling and how this would regulate embryonic development. Here we show that Clock1a coordinated mesoderm development and primitive hematopoiesis in zebrafish embryos by directly up-regulating Nodal-Smad3 signaling. We found that Clock1a is expressed both maternally and zygotically throughout early zebrafish development. We also noted that Clock1a alterations produce embryonic defects with shortened body length, lack of the ventral tail fin, or partial defect of the eyes. Clock1a regulates the expression of the mesodermal markers \textit{ntl, gsc}, and \textit{eve1} and of the hematopoietic markers \textit{scl}, \textit{lmo2}, and \textit{fli1a}. Biochemical analyses revealed that Clock1a stimulates Nodal signaling by increasing expression of Smad2/3/4. Mechanistically, Clock1a activates the \textit{smad3a} promoter via its E-box1 element (CAGATG). Taken together, these findings provide mechanistic insight into the role of Clock1a in the regulation of mesoderm development and primitive hematopoiesis via modulation of Nodal-Smad3 signaling and indicate that Smad3a is directly controlled by the circadian clock in zebrafish.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Astyanax mexicanus, a teleost fish comprising both sighted river and blind cave populations, is becoming more and more important in the field of developmental and evolutionary biology. As such, a developmental staging table is increasingly necessary, particularly since comparative analysis of early developmental events is widely employed by researchers. We collected freshly spawned embryos from surface fish and Pachón cavefish populations. Embryos were imaged every 10–12 min during the first day of development, and less frequently in the following days. The results provide an illustrated comparison of selected developmental stages from one cell to hatching of these two populations. The two morphs show an essentially synchronous development regarding major events such as epiboly, neurulation, somitogenesis, heart beating, or hatching. We also present data on particular morphological characters appearing during larval development, such as eye size, yolk regression, swim bladder, and fin development. Some details about the development of F1 Pachón cave×surface hybrids are also given. Comparisons are made with Danio rerio (zebrafish) development.},

Here, we have deciphered the sequence of defective events leading to coloboma in the embryonic eye of the blind cavefish of the species Astyanax mexicanus. Using comparative live imaging on targeted enhancer-trap Zic1:hsp70:GFP reporter lines of both the normal, river-dwelling morph and the cave morph of the species, we identified defects in migratory cell behaviours during evagination that participate in the reduced optic vesicle size in cavefish, without proliferation defect. Further, impaired optic cup invagination shifts the relative position of the lens and contributes to coloboma in cavefish. Based on these results, we propose a developmental scenario to explain the cavefish phenotype and discuss developmental constraints to morphological evolution. The cavefish eye appears as an outstanding natural mutant model to study molecular and cellular processes involved in optic region morphogenesis.},

	abstract = {Objective
Leptin gene expression is highly correlated with cellular lipid content in adipocytes but the transcriptional mechanisms controlling leptin expression in vivo are poorly understood. In this report, we set out to identify cis- and trans-regulatory elements controlling leptin expression.
Methods
Leptin-BAC luciferase transgenic mice combining with other computational and molecular techniques were used to identify transcription regulatory elements including a CCAAT-binding protein Nuclear Factor Y (NF-Y). The function of NF-Y in adipocyte was studied in vitro with 3T3-L1 cells and in vivo with adipocyte-specific knockout of NF-Y.
Results
Using Leptin-BAC luciferase mice, we showed that DNA sequences between −22 kb and +8.8 kb can confer quantitative expression of a leptin reporter. Computational analysis of sequences and gel shift assays identified a 32bp sequence (chr6: 28993820–2899385) consisting a CCAAT binding site for Nuclear Factor Y (NF-Y) and this was confirmed by a ChIP assay in vivo. A deletion of this 32bp sequence in the −22 kb to +8.8 kb leptin-luciferase BAC reporter completely abrogates luciferase reporter activity in vivo. RNAi mediated knockdown of NF-Y interfered with adipogenesis in vitro and adipocyte-specific knockout of NF-Y in mice reduced expression of leptin and other fat specific genes in vivo. Further analyses of the fat specific NF-Y knockout revealed that these animals develop a moderately severe lipodystrophy that is remediable with leptin therapy.
Conclusions
These studies advance our understanding of leptin gene expression and show that NF-Y controls the expression of leptin and other adipocyte genes and identifies a new form of lipodystrophy.},

This study investigated the role of KLF4 in angiogenesis and underlying molecular mechanisms in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs). The functional role of KLF4 in HRMECs was determined following lentiviral vector mediated inducible expression and shRNA knockdown of KLF4. Inducible expression of KLF4 promotes cell proliferation, migration and tube formation. In contrast, silencing KLF4 inhibits cell proliferation, migration, tube formation and induces apoptosis in HRMECs. KLF4 promotes angiogenesis by transcriptionally activating VEGF expression, thus activating the VEGF signaling pathway in HRMECs.},

In the mouse mutants,ectopic Shh expression is observed in the anterior mesenchyme of limb buds. Furthermore, a transgenic reporter gene flanked with this conserved non-coding region shows normal polarized expression in mouse limb buds. This conserved sequence has therefore been proposed to act as a long-range,cis-acting regulator of limb-specific Shh expression. Previous phylogenetic studies have also shown that this sequence is highly conserved among tetrapods, and even in teleost fishes. Paired fins of teleost fishes and tetrapod limbs have evolved from common ancestral appendages, and polarized Shh expression is commonly observed in fins. In this study, we first show that this conserved sequence motif is also physically linked to the Shh coding sequence in a teleost fish, the medaka, by homology search of a newly available genomic sequence database. Next, we show that deletion of this conserved intronic sequence by targeted mutation in the mouse results in a complete loss of Shh expression in the limb bud and degeneration of skeletal elements distal to the stylopod/zygopod junction. This sequence contains a major limb-specific Shh enhancer that is necessary for distal limb development. These results suggest that the conserved intronic sequence evolved in a common ancestor of fishes and tetrapods to control fin and limb development.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled the sequencing of several human genomes in their entirety. However, the routine resequencing of complete genomes remains infeasible. The massive capacity of next-generation sequencers can be harnessed for sequencing specific genomic regions in hundreds to thousands of individuals. Sequencing-based association studies are currently limited by the low level of multiplexing offered by sequencing platforms. Pooled sequencing represents a cost-effective approach for studying rare variants in large populations. To utilize the power of DNA pooling, it is important to accurately identify sequence variants from pooled sequencing data. Detection of rare variants from pooled sequencing represents a different challenge than detection of variants from individual sequencing., Results: We describe a novel statistical approach, CRISP [Comprehensive Read analysis for Identification of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) from Pooled sequencing] that is able to identify both rare and common variants by using two approaches: (i) comparing the distribution of allele counts across multiple pools using contingency tables and (ii) evaluating the probability of observing multiple non-reference base calls due to sequencing errors alone. Information about the distribution of reads between the forward and reverse strands and the size of the pools is also incorporated within this framework to filter out false variants. Validation of CRISP on two separate pooled sequencing datasets generated using the Illumina Genome Analyzer demonstrates that it can detect 80–85\% of SNPs identified using individual sequencing while achieving a low false discovery rate (3–5\%). Comparison with previous methods for pooled SNP detection demonstrates the significantly lower false positive and false negative rates for CRISP., Availability: Implementation of this method is available at http://polymorphism.scripps.edu/∼vbansal/software/CRISP/, Contact: vbansal@scripps.edu},

The role of the lens in retinal growth and development was studied in the teleost Astyanax mexicanus, which has eyed surface-dwelling (surface fish) and blind cave-dwelling (cavefish) forms. A lens and laminated retina initially develop in cavefish embryos, but the lens dies by apoptosis. The cavefish retina is subsequently disorganized, apoptotic cells appear, the photoreceptor layer degenerates, and retinal growth is arrested. We show here by PCNA, BrdU, and TUNEL labeling that cell proliferation continues in the adult cavefish retina but the newly born cells are removed by apoptosis. Surface fish to cavefish lens transplantation, which restores retinal growth and rod cell differentiation, abolished apoptosis in the retina but not in the RPE. Surface fish lens deletion did not cause apoptosis in the surface fish retina or affect RPE differentiation. Neither lens transplantation in cavefish nor lens deletion in surface fish affected retinal cell proliferation. We conclude that the lens acts in concert with another optic component, possibly the RPE, to promote retinal cell survival. Accordingly, deficiency in both optic structures may lead to eye degeneration in cavefish.},

Through synteny analysis and cDNA mapping, we have identified the KLF9 gene and determined that the gene presently named KLF1 is the true ortholog of KLF17 in other species. In situ hybridization expression analyses show that in general KLFs are broadly expressed in multiple cell and tissue types. Expression of KLFs 3, 7, 8, and 9, is widespread at all stages examined. KLFs 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 15, and 17 show more restricted patterns that suggest multiple functions during early stages of embryonic development.},

	abstract = {The fish Astyanax mexicanus comes in two forms: the normal surface-dwelling (SF) and the blind depigmented cave-adapted (CF) morphs. Among many phenotypic differences, cavefish show enhanced olfactory sensitivity to detect amino-acid odors and they possess large olfactory sensory organs. Here, we questioned the relationship between the size of the olfactory organ and olfactory capacities. Comparing olfactory detection abilities of CF, SF and F1 hybrids with various olfactory epithelium (OE) sizes in behavioral tests, we concluded that OE size is not the only factor involved. Other possibilities were envisaged. First, olfactory behavior was tested in SF raised in the dark or after embryonic lens ablation, which leads to eye degeneration and mimics the CF condition. Both absence of visual function and absence of visual organs improved the SF olfactory detection capacities, without affecting the size of their OE. This suggested that developmental plasticity occurs between the visual and the olfactory modalities, and can be recruited in SF after visual deprivation. Second, the development of the olfactory epithelium was compared in SF and CF in their first month of life. Proliferation, cell death, neuronal lifespan, and olfactory progenitor cell cycling properties were identical in the two morphs. By contrast, the proportions of the three main olfactory sensory neurons subtypes (ciliated, microvillous and crypt) in their OE differed. OMP-positive ciliated neurons were more represented in SF, TRPC2-positive microvillous neurons were proportionately more abundant in CF, and S100-positive crypt cells were found in equal densities in the two morphs. Thus, general proliferative properties of olfactory progenitors are identical but neurogenic properties differ and lead to variations in the neuronal composition of the OE in SF and CF. Together, these experiments suggest that there are at least two components in the evolution of cavefish olfactory skills: (1) one part of eye-dependent developmental phenotypic plasticity, which does not depend on the size of the olfactory organ, and (2) one part of developmental evolution of the OE, which may stem from embryonic specification of olfactory neurons progenitor pools.},

We show how the karyotypes of amphioxus and diverse vertebrates are derived from 17 ancestral chordate linkage groups (and 19 ancestral bilaterian groups) by fusion, rearrangement and duplication. We resolve two distinct ancient duplications based on patterns of chromosomal conserved synteny. All extant vertebrates share the first duplication, which occurred in the mid/late Cambrian by autotetraploidization (that is, direct genome doubling). In contrast, the second duplication is found only in jawed vertebrates and occurred in the mid–late Ordovician by allotetraploidization (that is, genome duplication following interspecific hybridization) from two now-extinct progenitors. This complex genomic history parallels the diversification of vertebrate lineages in the fossil record.

	abstract = {Evolution in response to a change in ecology often coincides with various morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits. For most organisms little is known about the genetic and functional relationship between evolutionarily derived traits, representing a critical gap in our understanding of adaptation. The Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, consists of largely independent populations of fish that inhabit at least 30 caves in Northeast Mexico, and a surface fish population, that inhabit the rivers of Mexico and Southern Texas. The recent application of molecular genetic approaches combined with behavioral phenotyping have established A. mexicanus as a model for studying the evolution of complex traits. Cave populations of A. mexicanus are interfertile with surface populations and have evolved numerous traits including eye degeneration, insomnia, albinism, and enhanced mechanosensory function. The interfertility of different populations from the same species provides a unique opportunity to define the genetic relationship between evolved traits and assess the co-evolution of behavioral and morphological traits with one another. To define the relationships between morphological and behavioral traits, we developed a pipeline to test individual fish for multiple traits. This pipeline confirmed differences in locomotor activity, prey capture, and startle reflex between surface and cavefish populations. To measure the relationship between traits, individual F2 hybrid fish were characterized for locomotor behavior, prey-capture behavior, startle reflex, and morphological attributes. Analysis revealed an association between body length and slower escape reflex, suggesting a trade-off between increased size and predator avoidance in cavefish. Overall, there were few associations between individual behavioral traits, or behavioral and morphological traits, suggesting independent genetic changes underlie the evolution of the measured behavioral and morphological traits. Taken together, this approach provides a novel system to identify genetic underpinnings of naturally occurring variation in morphological and behavioral traits.},

We determined the evolution of plasticity in gene expression by conducting laboratory natural selection on a Drosophila simulans population in hot and cold environments. After more than 60 generations in the hot environment, 325 genes evolved a change in plasticity relative to the natural ancestral population. Plasticity increased in 75\% of these genes, which were strongly enriched for several well-defined functional categories (e.g., chitin metabolism, glycolysis, and oxidative phosphorylation). Furthermore, we show that plasticity in gene expression of populations exposed to different temperatures is rather similar across species. We conclude that most of the ancestral plasticity can evolve further in more extreme environments.},

Adaptation can take many shapes and occur at different speeds, depending on the type of response, the trait, the population, and the environmental conditions. The biodiversity crisis that we are currently facing illustrates that numerous species and populations are not capable of adapting with sufficient speed to ongoing environmental changes. Here, we discuss current knowledge on the ability of animals and plants to adapt to environmental stress on different timescales, mainly focusing on thermal stress and ectotherms. We discuss within-generation responses that can be fast and induced within minutes or hours, evolutionary adaptations that are often slow and take several generations, and mechanisms that lay somewhere in between and that include epigenetic transgenerational effects. To understand and predict the impacts of environmental change and stress on biodiversity, we suggest that future studies should (1) have an increased focus on understanding the type and speed of responses to fast environmental changes; (2) focus on the importance of environmental fluctuations and the predictability of environmental conditions on adaptive capabilities, preferably in field studies encompassing several fitness components; and (3) look at ecosystem responses to environmental stress and their resilience when disturbed.},

	abstract = {How populations and species respond to modified environmental conditions is critical to their persistence both now and into the future, particularly given the increasing pace of environmental change. The process of adaptation to novel environmental conditions can occur via two mechanisms: (1) the expression of phenotypic plasticity (the ability of one genotype to express varying phenotypes when exposed to different environmental conditions), and (2) evolution via selection for particular phenotypes, resulting in the modification of genetic variation in the population. Plasticity, because it acts at the level of the individual, is often hailed as a rapid-response mechanism that will enable organisms to adapt and survive in our rapidly changing world. But plasticity can also retard adaptation by shifting the distribution of phenotypes in the population, shielding it from natural selection. In addition to which, not all plastic responses are adaptive—now well-documented in cases of ecological traps. In this theme issue, we aim to present a considered view of plasticity and the role it could play in facilitating or hindering adaption to environmental change. This introduction provides a re-examination of our current understanding of the role of phenotypic plasticity in adaptation and sets the theme issue's contributions in their broader context. Four key themes emerge: the need to measure plasticity across both space and time; the importance of the past in predicting the future; the importance of the link between plasticity and sexual selection; and the need to understand more about the nature of selection on plasticity itself. We conclude by advocating the need for cross-disciplinary collaborations to settle the question of whether plasticity will promote or retard species' rates of adaptation to ever-more stressful environmental conditions., This article is part of the theme issue ‘The role of plasticity in phenotypic adaptation to rapid environmental change’.},

	abstract = {Astyanax mexicanus, a teleost fish that exists in a river-dwelling surface form and multiple cave-dwelling forms, is an excellent system for studying the genetic basis of evolution. Cavefish populations, which independently evolved from surface fish ancestors multiple times, have evolved a number of morphological and behavioral traits. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses have been performed to identify the genetic basis of many of these traits. These studies, combined with recent sequencing of the genome, provide a unique opportunity to identify candidate genes for these cave-specific traits. However, tools to test the requirement of these genes must be established to evaluate the role of candidate genes in generating cave-specific traits. To address this need, we designed transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to target two genes that contain coding changes in cavefish relative to surface fish and map to the same location as QTL for pigmentation, oculocutaneous albinism 2 (oca2) and melanocortin 1 receptor (mc1r). We found that surface fish genes can be mutated using this method. TALEN-induced mutations in oca2 result in mosaic loss of melanin pigmentation visible as albino patches in F0 founder fish, suggesting biallelic gene mutations in F0s and allowing us to evaluate the role of this gene in pigmentation. The pigment cells in the albino patches can produce melanin upon treatment with L-DOPA, behaving similarly to pigment cells in albino cavefish and providing additional evidence that oca2 is the gene within the QTL responsible for albinism in cavefish. This technology has the potential to introduce a powerful tool for studying the role of candidate genes responsible for the evolution of cavefish traits.},

Species of cavefish from around the world display a convergent evolution of morphological and behavioral traits due to shared environmental pressures between different cave systems. Diverse cave species have been studied in the laboratory setting. The Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, with sighted and blind forms, has provided unique insights into biological and molecular processes underlying the evolution of complex traits and is well-poised as an emerging model system. While candidate genes regulating the evolution of diverse biological processes have been identified in A. mexicanus, the ability to validate a role for individual genes has been limited. The application of transgenesis and gene-editing technology has the potential to overcome this significant impediment and to investigate the mechanisms underlying the evolution of complex traits. Here, we describe a different methodology for manipulating gene expression in A. mexicanus. Approaches include the use of morpholinos, Tol2 transgenesis, and gene-editing systems, commonly used in zebrafish and other fish models, to manipulate gene function in A. mexicanus. These protocols include detailed descriptions of timed breeding procedures, the collection of fertilized eggs, injections, and the selection of genetically modified animals. These methodological approaches will allow for the investigation of the genetic and neural mechanisms underlying the evolution of diverse traits in A. mexicanus.},

We generated oca2 mutant surface A. mexicanus. Surface fish with oca2 mutations are albino due to a disruption in the first step of the melanin synthesis pathway, the same step that is disrupted in albino cavefish. Hybrid offspring from crosses between oca2 mutant surface and cavefish are albino, definitively demonstrating the role of this gene in the evolution of albinism in this species. This research elucidates the role oca2 plays in pigmentation in fish, and establishes that this gene is solely responsible for the evolution of albinism in multiple cavefish populations.

In diverse fish species, acoustic stimuli activate Mauthner neurons, which initiate a C-start escape response. This reflexive behavior is highly conserved across aquatic species and provides a model for investigating the neural mechanism underlying the evolution of escape behavior. Here, we characterize evolved differences in the C-start response between populations of the Mexican cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus. Cave populations of A. mexicanus inhabit an environment devoid of light and macroscopic predators, resulting in evolved differences in various morphological and behavioral traits. We find that the C-start is present in river-dwelling surface fish and multiple populations of cavefish, but that response kinematics and probability differ between populations. The Pachón population of cavefish exhibits an increased response probability, a slower response latency and speed, and reduction of the maximum bend angle, revealing evolved differences between surface and cave populations. Analysis of the responses of two other independently evolved populations of cavefish, revealed the repeated evolution of reduced angular speed. Investigation of surface-cave hybrids reveals a correlation between angular speed and peak angle, suggesting these two kinematic characteristics are related at the genetic or functional levels. Together, these findings provide support for the use of A. mexicanus as a model to investigate the evolution of escape behavior.},

	abstract = {The small teleost fish Astyanax mexicanus has emerged as an outstanding model for studying many biological topics in the context of evolution. A major attribute is conspecific surface dwelling (surface fish) and blind cave dwelling (cavefish) morphs that can be raised in the laboratory and spawn large numbers of transparent and synchronously developing embryos. More than 30 cavefish populations have been discovered, mostly in northeastern Mexico, and some are thought to have evolved independently from surface fish ancestors, providing excellent models of parallel and convergent evolution. Cavefish have evolved eye and pigmentation regression, as well as modifications in brain morphology, behaviors, heart regenerative capacity, metabolic processes, and craniofacial organization. Thus, the Astyanax model provides researchers with natural “mutants” to study life in the challenging cave environment. The application of powerful genetic approaches based on hybridization between the two morphs and between the different cavefish populations are key advantages for deciphering the developmental and genetic mechanisms regulating trait evolution. QTL analysis has revealed the genetic architectures of gained and lost traits. In addition, some cavefish traits resemble human diseases, offering novel models for biomedical research. Astyanax research is supported by genome assemblies, transcriptomes, tissue and organ transplantation, gene manipulation and editing, and stable transgenesis, and benefits from a welcoming and interactive research community that conducts integrated community projects and sponsors the International Astyanax Meeting (AIM).},

	abstract = {The evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the loss of eyes in cave animals are still unresolved. Hypotheses invoking natural selection or neutral mutation have been advanced to explain eye regression. Here we describe comparative molecular and developmental studies in the teleost Astyanax mexicanus that shed new light on this problem. A. mexicanus is a single species consisting of a sighted surface-dwelling form (surface fish) and many blind cave-dwelling forms (cavefish) from different caves. We first review the evolutionary relationships of Astyanax cavefish populations and conclude that eye degeneration may have evolved multiple times. We then compare the mechanisms of eye degeneration in different cavefish populations. We describe the results of experiments showing that programmed cell death of the lens plays a key role in controlling eye degeneration in these cavefish populations. We also show that Pax6 gene expression and fate determination in the optic primordia are modified similarly in different cavefish populations, probably due to hyperactive midline signaling. We discuss the contributions of the comparative developmental approach toward resolving the evolutionary mechanisms of eye degeneration. A new hypothesis is presented in which both natural selection and neutral mutation are proposed to have roles in cavefish eye degeneration.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneous genetic divergence can accumulate across the genome when populations adapt to different habitats while still exchanging alleles. How long does diversification take and how much of the genome is affected? When divergence occurs in parallel from standing genetic variation, how often are the same haplotypes involved? We explore these questions using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing genotyping data and show that broad-scale genomic repatterning, fueled by copious standing variation, can emerge in just dozens of generations in replicate natural populations of threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus). After the catastrophic 1964 Alaskan earthquake, marine stickleback colonized newly created ponds on seismically uplifted islands. We find that freshwater fish in these young ponds differ from their marine ancestors across the same genomic segments previously shown to have diverged in much older lake populations. Outside of these core divergent regions the genome shows no population structure across the ocean-freshwater divide, consistent with strong local selection acting in alternative environments on stickleback populations still connected by significant gene flow. Reinforcing this inference, a majority of divergent haplotypes that are at high frequency in ponds are detectable in the sea, even across great geographic distances. Building upon previous population genomics work in this model species, our data suggest that a long history of divergent selection and gene flow among stickleback populations in oceanic and freshwater habitats has maintained polymorphisms of alternatively adapted DNA sequences that facilitate parallel evolution.},

Extensive genomic resources, including linkage maps, a high-quality reference genome, and developmental genetics tools have led to insights into the genomic basis of adaptation and the identification of genomic changes controlling traits in vertebrates. Recently, threespine sticklebacks have been used as a model system to identify the genomic basis of highly complex traits, such as behavior and host–microbiome and host–parasite interactions.

	abstract = {Limb reduction and loss are hallmarks of snake evolution. Although advanced snakes are completely limbless, basal and intermediate snakes retain pelvic girdles and small rudiments of the femur. Moreover, legs may have re-emerged in extinct snake lineages [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], suggesting that the mechanisms of limb development were not completely lost in snakes. Here we report that hindlimb development arrests in python embryos as a result of mutations that abolish essential transcription factor binding sites in the limb-specific enhancer of Sonic hedgehog (SHH). Consequently, SHH transcription is weak and transient in python hindlimb buds, leading to early termination of a genetic circuit that drives limb outgrowth. Our results suggest that degenerate evolution of the SHH limb enhancer played a role in reduction of hindlimbs during snake evolution. By contrast, HOXD digit enhancers are conserved in pythons, and HOXD gene expression in the hindlimb buds progresses to the distal phase, forming an autopodial (digit) domain. Python hindlimb buds then develop transitory pre-chondrogenic condensations of the tibia, fibula, and footplate, raising the possibility that re-emergence of hindlimbs during snake evolution did not require de novo re-evolution of lost structures but instead could have resulted from persistence of embryonic legs.

	abstract = {The evolution of body shape is thought to be tightly coupled to changes in regulatory sequences, but specific molecular events associated with major morphological transitions in vertebrates have remained elusive. We identified snake-specific sequence changes within an otherwise highly conserved long-range limb enhancer of Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Transgenic mouse reporter assays revealed that the in vivo activity pattern of the enhancer is conserved across a wide range of vertebrates, including fish, but not in snakes. Genomic substitution of the mouse enhancer with its human or fish ortholog results in normal limb development. In contrast, replacement with snake orthologs caused severe limb reduction. Synthetic restoration of a single transcription factor binding site lost in the snake lineage reinstated full in vivo function to the snake enhancer. Our results demonstrate changes in a regulatory sequence associated with a major body plan transition and highlight the role of enhancers in morphological evolution.

	abstract = {The evolution of snakes involved dramatic modifications to the ancestral lizard body plan. Limb loss and elongation of the trunk are hallmarks of snakes, although convergent evolution of limb-reduced and trunk-elongated forms occurred multiple times in snake-like lizards. Advanced snakes are completely limbless, but intermediate and basal snakes have retained rudiments of hindlimbs and pelvic girdles. Moreover, the snake fossil record indicates that complete legs were re-acquired at least once, suggesting that the potential for limb development was retained in some limb-reduced taxa. Recent work has shown that python embryos initiate development of a transitory distal leg skeleton, including a footplate, and that the limb-specific enhancer of the Sonic hedgehog gene, known as the zone of polarizing activity regulatory sequence (ZRS), underwent gradual degeneration during snake evolution. In this article, we review historical and recent investigations into squamate limblessness, and we discuss how new genomic and functional genetic experiments have improved our understanding of the evolution of limblessness in snakes. Finally, we explore the idea that pleiotropy of cis-regulatory elements may illuminate the convergent genetic changes that occurred in snake-like lizards, and we discuss a number of challenges that remain to be addressed in future studies.},

	abstract = {Cephalochordates, urochordates, and vertebrates evolved from a common ancestor over 520 million years ago. To improve our understanding of chordate evolution and the origin of vertebrates, we intensively searched for particular genes, gene families, and conserved noncoding elements in the sequenced genome of the cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae, commonly called amphioxus or lancelets. Special attention was given to homeobox genes, opsin genes, genes involved in neural crest development, nuclear receptor genes, genes encoding components of the endocrine and immune systems, and conserved cis-regulatory enhancers. The amphioxus genome contains a basic set of chordate genes involved in development and cell signaling, including a fifteenth Hox gene. This set includes many genes that were co-opted in vertebrates for new roles in neural crest development and adaptive immunity. However, where amphioxus has a single gene, vertebrates often have two, three, or four paralogs derived from two whole-genome duplication events. In addition, several transcriptional enhancers are conserved between amphioxus and vertebrates—a very wide phylogenetic distance. In contrast, urochordate genomes have lost many genes, including a diversity of homeobox families and genes involved in steroid hormone function. The amphioxus genome also exhibits derived features, including duplications of opsins and genes proposed to function in innate immunity and endocrine systems. Our results indicate that the amphioxus genome is elemental to an understanding of the biology and evolution of nonchordate deuterostomes, invertebrate chordates, and vertebrates.},

Gar bridges teleosts to tetrapods by illuminating the evolution of immunity, mineralization and development (mediated, for example, by Hox, ParaHox and microRNA genes). Numerous conserved noncoding elements (CNEs; often cis regulatory) undetectable in direct human-teleost comparisons become apparent using gar: functional studies uncovered conserved roles for such cryptic CNEs, facilitating annotation of sequences identified in human genome-wide association studies. Transcriptomic analyses showed that the sums of expression domains and expression levels for duplicated teleost genes often approximate the patterns and levels of expression for gar genes, consistent with subfunctionalization.

However, when we plotted the genomic map positions of only the subset of paralogous genes that were duplicated prior to the fish–tetrapod split, their global physical organization provides unmistakable evidence of two distinct genome duplication events early in vertebrate evolution indicated by clear patterns of four-way paralogous regions covering a large part of the human genome. Our results highlight the potential for these large-scale genomic events to have driven the evolutionary success of the vertebrate lineage.},

	abstract = {Tunicates or urochordates (appendicularians, salps and sea squirts), cephalochordates (lancelets) and vertebrates (including lamprey and hagfish) constitute the three extant groups of chordate animals. Traditionally, cephalochordates are considered as the closest living relatives of vertebrates, with tunicates representing the earliest chordate lineage. This view is mainly justified by overall morphological similarities and an apparently increased complexity in cephalochordates and vertebrates relative to tunicates. Despite their critical importance for understanding the origins of vertebrates, phylogenetic studies of chordate relationships have provided equivocal results. Taking advantage of the genome sequencing of the appendicularian Oikopleura dioica, we assembled a phylogenomic data set of 146 nuclear genes (33,800 unambiguously aligned amino acids) from 14 deuterostomes and 24 other slowly evolving species as an outgroup. Here we show that phylogenetic analyses of this data set provide compelling evidence that tunicates, and not cephalochordates, represent the closest living relatives of vertebrates. Chordate monophyly remains uncertain because cephalochordates, albeit with a non-significant statistical support, surprisingly grouped with echinoderms, a hypothesis that needs to be tested with additional data. This new phylogenetic scheme prompts a reappraisal of both morphological and palaeontological data and has important implications for the interpretation of developmental and genomic studies in which tunicates and cephalochordates are used as model animals.},

Here, we examine the expression of Hox genes in snake embryos and show that a collinear pattern of Hox expression is retained within the paraxial mesoderm of the trunk. Genes expressed at the anterior and most posterior, regionalized, parts of the skeleton correspond to the expected anatomical boundaries. Unexpectedly however, also the dorsal (thoracic), homogenous rib-bearing region of trunk, is regionalized by unconventional gradual anterior limits of Hox expression that are not obviously reflected in the skeletal anatomy. In the lateral plate mesoderm we also detect regionalized Hox expression yet the forelimb marker Tbx5 is not restricted to a rudimentary forelimb domain but is expressed throughout the entire flank region. Analysis of several Hox genes in a caecilian amphibian, which convergently evolved a deregionalized body plan, reveals a similar global collinear pattern of Hox expression. The differential expression of posterior, vertebra-modifying or even rib-suppressing Hox genes within the dorsal region is inconsistent with the homogeneity in vertebral identity. Our results suggest that the evolution of a deregionalized, snake-like body involved not only alterations in Hox gene cis-regulation but also a different downstream interpretation of the Hox code.},

	abstract = {Patterning of the vertebrate skeleton requires the coordinated activity of Hox genes. In particular, Hox10 proteins are essential to set the transition from thoracic to lumbar vertebrae because of their rib-repressing activity. In snakes, however, the thoracic region extends well into Hox10-expressing areas of the embryo, suggesting that these proteins are unable to block rib formation. Here, we show that this is not a result of the loss of rib-repressing properties by the snake proteins, but rather to a single base pair change in a Hox/Paired box (Pax)-responsive enhancer, which prevents the binding of Hox proteins. This polymorphism is also found in Paenungulata, such as elephants and manatees, which have extended rib cages. In vivo, this modified enhancer failed to respond to Hox10 activity, supporting its role in the extension of rib cages. In contrast, the enhancer could still interact with Hoxb6 and Pax3 to promote rib formation. These results suggest that a polymorphism in the Hox/Pax-responsive enhancer may have played a role in the evolution of the vertebrate spine by differently modulating its response to rib-suppressing and rib-promoting Hox proteins.},

Evolutionary changes in Hox gene function are believed to be involved in the emergence of the diverse body plans we observe in animals today. Spiders share many body plan features with other arthropods, but also have numerous unique traits of their own. Studies of spider Hox genes have already provided insights into evolutionarily conserved and derived features of the spider body plan and their genetic basis. However, many aspects of Hox gene biology have been insufficiently studied in spiders so far. In this review, we highlight previous comparative studies of Hox genes in spiders and their significance for our understanding of the evolution of the spider body plan. We also identify aspects of Hox gene biology that need to be studied in greater detail. Many spider Hox genes have not been investigated beyond their mRNA expression patterns, and the role of Hox genes with apparently plesiomorphic or dual functions, like ftz and Hox3 is still unclear. Spiders have a duplicated Hox gene cluster, but possible sub- or neofunctionalisation of duplicates have not yet been studied systematically. Future research should therefore focus on these issues, in addition to the role of Polycomb and trithorax-mediated regulation, the identification of regulatory regions, cofactors or spider-specific target genes, and the significance of non-coding RNAs transcribed from within the Hox cluster and even from the antisense strand of particular Hox genes.},

Here, we show that excess DNA methylation-based epigenetic silencing promotes eye degeneration in blind cave A. mexicanus. By performing parallel analyses in A. mexicanus cave and surface morphs, and in the zebrafish Danio rerio, we have discovered that DNA methylation mediates eye-specific gene repression and globally regulates early eye development. The most significantly hypermethylated and downregulated genes in the cave morph are also linked to human eye disorders, suggesting that the function of these genes is conserved across vertebrates. Our results show that changes in DNA methylation-based gene repression can serve as an important molecular mechanism generating phenotypic diversity during development and evolution.},

We established reproducing populations of cave- and surface-dwelling loaches to produce cave, surface, and hybrid offspring and reared the F1 fish in a common garden setting in total darkness (DD) to simulate cave conditions as well as under the natural photoperiod (DL). We observed significant differences in the occurrence and extent of typical troglomorphic target characters among the offspring groups. Regardless of rearing conditions, cave fish exhibited smaller eyes, lighter body coloration, longer barbels, and larger olfactory epithelium than seen in surface fish. Hybrids in both rearing conditions generally showed an intermediate level of these traits. Surface and hybrid DD fish differed from the DL groups, resembling the cave fish phenotype in several traits, including eye size and body pigmentation. In contrast, cave and hybrid DL fish groups resembled surface fish phenotypes. Results confirmed that troglomorphic traits arise from heritable genetic differentiation of cave from surface forms and that phenotypic plasticity contributes to the process of adaptation to novel light conditions.},

The cost of vision was calculated to be 15\% of resting metabolism for a 1-g fish, decreasing to 5\% in an 8.5-g fish as relative eye and brain size declined during growth. Our results demonstrate that the loss of the visual system in the cave phenotype substantially lowered the amount of energy expended on expensive neural tissue during diversification into subterranean rivers, in particular for juvenile fish.},

We used an integrative genomics approach to evaluate the relationships among developmental plasticity, molecular evolution, and social behavior in a bee species (Megalopta genalis) that expresses flexible sociality, and thus provides a window into the factors that may have been important at the evolutionary origins of eusociality. We find that differences in social behavior are derived from genes that also regulate sex differentiation and metamorphosis. Positive selection on social traits is influenced by the function of these genes in development. We further identify evidence that social polyphenisms may become encoded in the genome via genetic changes in regulatory regions, specifically in transcription factor binding sites. Taken together, our results provide evidence that developmental plasticity provides the substrate for evolutionary novelty and shapes the selective landscape for molecular evolution in a major evolutionary innovation: Eusociality.},

Despite its popularity, this juxtaposition is deeply misleading....Phenotypic variation is generated by the processes of development, with some variants arising more readily than others—a phenomenon known as “developmental bias.” Developmental bias and natural selection have often been portrayed as alternative explanations, but this is a false dichotomy: developmental bias can evolve through natural selection, and bias and selection jointly influence phenotypic evolution. Here, we briefly review the evidence for developmental bias and illustrate how it is studied empirically. We describe recent theory on regulatory networks that explains why the influence of genetic and environmental perturbation on phenotypes is typically not uniform, and may even be biased toward adaptive phenotypic variation. We show how bias produced by developmental processes constitutes an evolving property able to impose direction on adaptive evolution and influence patterns of taxonomic and phenotypic diversity. Taking these considerations together, we argue that it is not sufficient to accommodate developmental bias into evolutionary theory merely as a constraint on evolutionary adaptation. The influence of natural selection in shaping developmental bias, and conversely, the influence of developmental bias in shaping subsequent opportunities for adaptation, requires mechanistic models of development to be expanded and incorporated into evolutionary theory. A regulatory network perspective on phenotypic evolution thus helps to integrate the generation of phenotypic variation with natural selection, leaving evolutionary biology better placed to explain how organisms adapt and diversify.},

	abstract = {The process of multicellular organismal development hinges upon the specificity of developmental programs: for different parts of the organism to form unique features, processes must exist to specify each part. This specificity is thought to be hardwired into gene regulatory networks, which activate cohorts of genes in particular tissues at particular times during development. However, the evolution of gene regulatory networks sometimes occurs by mechanisms that sacrifice specificity. One such mechanism is network co-option, in which existing gene networks are redeployed in new developmental contexts. While network co-option may offer an efficient mechanism for generating novel phenotypes, losses of tissue specificity at redeployed network genes could restrict the ability of the affected traits to evolve independently. At present, there has not been a detailed discussion regarding how tissue specificity of network genes might be altered due to gene network co-option at its initiation, as well as how trait independence can be retained or restored after network co-option. A lack of clarity about network co-option makes it more difficult to speculate on the long-term evolutionary implications of this mechanism. In this review, we will discuss the possible initial outcomes of network co-option, outline the mechanisms by which networks may retain or subsequently regain specificity after network co-option, and comment on some of the possible evolutionary consequences of network co-option. We place special emphasis on the need to consider selectively-neutral outcomes of network co-option to improve our understanding of the role of this mechanism in trait evolution.},

Early anatomical and embryological datasets identified distinctive morphological regions within the appendage and posed hypotheses about how the loss, gain, and transformation of these regions could explain the observed patterns of both extant and fossil appendage diversity. These hypotheses have been put to the test by our growing understanding of patterning mechanisms that regulate formation of the appendage axes, comparisons of gene expression data from an array of phylogenetically informative taxa, and increasingly sophisticated and elegant experiments leveraging the latest molecular approaches. Together, these data demonstrate the remarkable conservation of developmental mechanisms, even across phylogenetically and morphologically disparate taxa, as well as raising new questions about the way we view homology, evolutionary novelty, and the often non-linear connection between morphology and gene expression. In this review, we present historical hypotheses regarding paired fin evolution and limb origins, summarize key aspects of central appendage patterning mechanisms in model and non-model species, address how modern comparative developmental data interface with our understanding of appendage anatomy, and highlight new approaches that promise to provide new insight into these well-traveled questions.},

The morphology of these paired fins in fishes at different phylogenetic positions suggests an evolutionary tendency for increasing elaboration of the endoskeleton and concomitant reduction of the distal dermoskeleton. This evolutionary process culminated with the origin of limbs in the lineages leading to tetrapods. The developmental programs responsible for the evolution of vertebrate appendages have been a major topic for evolutionary developmental biology recently. Gene expression comparisons performed in chordates explored how these mechanisms were transferred from a midline to latero-ventral position. On another front, gene function assays have begun to test classical hypotheses concerning the transition from fish fins to tetrapod limbs. In this review, we highlight these recent findings on the evolution of vertebrate fin development. First, we discuss new perspectives on the transition from midline to paired appendages focus on (i) origin and molecular regionalization of the lateral plate mesoderm and (ii) novel ectodermic competency zones for fin induction. Next, we review recent work exploring how tetrapod limbs evolved from fish fins, considering (i) molecular and structural changes in the distal ectoderm of fins and (ii) modulation of 5'HoxD transcription during fin endoskeleton development.},

	abstract = {In their seminal 1983 paper, Gans and Northcutt proposed that evolution of the vertebrate 'new head' was made possible by the advent of the neural crest and cranial placodes. The neural crest is a stem cell population that arises adjacent to the forming CNS and contributes to important cell types, including components of the peripheral nervous system and craniofacial skeleton and elements of the cardiovascular system. In the past few years, the new head hypothesis has been challenged by the discovery in invertebrate chordates of cells with some, but not all, characteristics of vertebrate neural crest cells. Here, we discuss recent findings regarding how neural crest cells may have evolved during the course of deuterostome evolution. The results suggest that there was progressive addition of cell types to the repertoire of neural crest derivatives throughout vertebrate evolution. Novel genomic tools have enabled higher resolution insight into neural crest evolution, from both a cellular and a gene regulatory perspective. Together, these data provide clues regarding the ancestral neural crest state and how the neural crest continues to evolve to contribute to the success of vertebrates as efficient predators.},

These assets have enabled the rapid identification of numerous notochord genes and cis-regulatory regions, and provide a rather unique opportunity to reconstruct the gene regulatory network that controls the formation of this developmental and evolutionary chordate landmark. This chapter summarizes the morphogenetic milestones that punctuate notochord formation in Ciona, their molecular effectors, and the current knowledge of the gene regulatory network that ensures the accurate spatial and temporal orchestration of these processes.},

	abstract = {The notochord is a major regulator of embryonic patterning in vertebrates and abnormal notochordal development is associated with a variety of birth defects in man. Proper knowledge of the development of the human notochord, therefore, is important to understand the pathogenesis of these birth defects. Textbook descriptions vary significantly and seem to be derived from both human and animal data whereas the lack of references hampers verification of the presented data. Therefore, a verifiable and comprehensive description of the development of the human notochord is needed. Our analysis and three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of 27 sectioned human embryos ranging from Carnegie Stage 8 to 15 (17–41 days of development), resulted in a comprehensive and verifiable new model of notochordal development. Subsequent to gastrulation, a transient group of cells briefly persists as the notochordal process which is incorporated into the endodermal roof of the gut while its dorsal side attaches to the developing neural tube. Then, the notochordal process embeds entirely into the endoderm, forming the epithelial notochordal plate, which remains intimately associated with the neural tube. Subsequently, the notochordal cells detach from the endoderm to form the definitive notochord, allowing the paired dorsal aortae to fuse between the notochord and the gut. We show that the formation of the notochordal process and plate proceeds in cranio-caudal direction. Moreover, in contrast to descriptions in the modern textbooks, we report that the formation of the definitive notochord in humans starts in the middle of the embryo, and proceeds in both cranial and caudal directions.},

The partial characterization of this gene cluster revealed the presence of two novel genes (Hox-5.2, Hox-5.3) located at the 5' extremity of this complex. In situ hybridization experiments showed that these two genes are transcribed in very posterior domains during embryonic and foetal development. We also show that Hox-1.6, the gene located at the 3' most position in the HOX-1 complex, has a very anterior expression boundary during early development. These results clearly support the recently proposed hypothesis that the expression of murine Antp-like homeobox-containing genes along the antero-posterior developing body axis follows a positional hierarchy which reflects their respective physical positions within the HOX clusters, similar to that which is found for the Drosophila homeotic genes. Such a structural and functional organization is likely conserved in most vertebrates. Moreover, on the basis of sequence comparisons, we propose that the ordering of homeobox-containing genes within clusters has been conserved between Drosophila and the house mouse. Thus, very different body plans might be achieved, both in insects and vertebrates, by evolutionarily conserved gene networks possibly displaying similar regulatory interactions.},

Genomic DNA contains three kinds of basic information: (1) genetic information, which is passed on from generation to generation; (2) a precise developmental program, according to which an organism develops and functions; and (3) historical information, reflecting the evolution of the organism. How the linear information, stored in the sequence of the nucleotides in the DNA, is translated into the three-dimensional structure of an organism (or into four dimensions if we also include time as an additional dimension) is the enigma of developmental genetics. Organisms have their own history, going back millions of years, and develop along historical lines. They are not constructed in the most rational and economic way, although reproduction and development have been optimized to a large extent in the course of evolution. Some aspects of development can only be understood on the basis of their evolutionary history. This historical component sometimes makes it difficult to distinguish...},

However, how CTCF and a perturbed chromatin structure impacts gene expression during development remains poorly understood. Here we link the loss of CTCF and gene regulation during patterning and organogenesis in a ctcf knockout zebrafish model. CTCF absence leads to loss of chromatin structure and affects the expression of thousands of genes, including many developmental regulators.

Here we report that zebrafish embryos without maternally provided vg1 fail to form endoderm and head and trunk mesoderm, and closely resemble nodal loss-of-function mutants. Although Nodal is processed and secreted without Vg1, it requires Vg1 for its endogenous activity. Conversely, Vg1 is unprocessed and resides in the endoplasmic reticulum without Nodal, and is only secreted, processed and active in the presence of Nodal. Co-expression of Nodal and Vg1 results in heterodimer formation and mesendoderm induction. Thus, mesendoderm induction relies on the combination of two TGF-beta-related signals: maternal and ubiquitous Vg1, and zygotic and localized Nodal. Modeling reveals that the pool of maternal Vg1 enables rapid signaling at low concentrations of zygotic Nodal.},

	abstract = {Retinoic acid (RA) repression of Fgf8 is required for many different aspects of organogenesis, however relatively little is known about how endogenous RA controls gene repression as opposed to gene activation. Here, we show that nuclear receptor corepressors NCOR1 and NCOR2 (SMRT) redundantly mediate the ability of RA to repress Fgf8. Ncor1;Ncor2 double mutants generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing exhibited a small somite and distended heart phenotype similar to that of RA-deficient Raldh2−/− embryos, associated with increased Fgf8 expression and FGF signaling in caudal progenitors and heart progenitors. Embryo chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that NCOR1/2 but not coactivators are recruited to the Fgf8 RA response element (RARE) in an RA-dependent manner, whereas coactivators but not NCOR1/2 are recruited RA-dependently to a RARE near Rarb that is activated by RA. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic deletion of the Fgf8 RARE in mouse embryos often resulted in a small somite defect with Fgf8 derepression caudally, but no defect was observed in heart development or heart Fgf8 expression. This suggests the existence of another DNA element whose function overlaps with the Fgf8 RARE to mediate Fgf8 repression by RA and NCOR1/2. Our studies support a model in which NCOR1/2 mediates direct RA-dependent repression of Fgf8 in caudal progenitors in order to control somitogenesis.},

The spatio-temporal distribution of embryonic RA results from regulated expression of RA-synthesizing retinaldehyde dehydrogenases and RA-metabolizing cytochrome P450s (CYP26). Excess RA administration or RA deficiency results in a complex spectrum of embryonic abnormalities. As a first step in understanding the developmental function of RA-metabolizing enzymes, we have disrupted the murine Cyp26A1 gene. We report that Cyp26A1-null mutants die during mid-late gestation and show a number of major morphogenetic defects. Spina bifida and truncation of the tail and lumbosacral region (including abnormalities of the kidneys, urogenital tract, and hindgut) are the most conspicuous defects, leading in extreme cases to a sirenomelia ("mermaid tail") phenotype. Cyp26A1 mutants also show posterior transformations of cervical vertebrae and abnormal patterning of the rostral hindbrain, which appears to be partially posteriorly transformed. These defects correlate with two major sites of Cyp26A1 expression in the rostral neural plate and embryonic tail bud. Because all of the Cyp26A1(-/-) abnormalities closely resemble RA teratogenic effects, we postulate that the key function of CYP26A1 is to maintain specific embryonic areas in a RA-depleted state, to protect them against the deleterious effect of ectopic RA signaling.},

However, the treatment of patients with ARS remains mostly supportive and palliative.    The authors used molecular genetic, pharmacologic, and embryologic techniques to study the biology of ARS in a zebrafish model that uses transgenes to mark neural crest and muscle cells in the head.    The authors demonstrated in vivo that pitx2 is a key downstream target of retinoic acid (RA) in craniofacial development, and this pathway is required for coordinating neural crest, mesoderm, and ocular development. pitx2a knockdown using morpholino oligonucleotides disrupts jaw and pharyngeal arch formation and recapitulates ocular characteristics of ARS, including corneal and iris stroma maldevelopment. These phenotypes could be rescued with human PITX2A mRNA, demonstrating the specificity of the knockdown and evolutionary conservation of pitx2a function. Expression of the ARS dominant negative human PITX2A K50E allele also caused ARS-like phenotypes. Similarly, inhibition of RA synthesis in the developing eye (genetic or pharmacologic) disrupted craniofacial and ocular development, and human PITX2A mRNA partially rescued these defects.    RA regulation of pitx2 is essential for coordinating interactions among neural crest, mesoderm, and developing eye. The marked evolutionary conservation of Pitx2 function in eye and craniofacial development makes zebrafish a potentially powerful model of ARS, amenable to in vivo experimentation and development of potential therapies.},

Studies in chick using treatment with RA or RA receptor antagonists suggested a two-signal model for limb proximodistal patterning in which a proximal RA signal opposes a distal fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signal.Genetic loss-of-function studies in mice confirmed a requirement for distal FGF but not proximal RA in limb proximodistal patterning, thus supporting a one-signal model in which distal FGFs alone control patterning. RA was found to promote forelimb initiation by repressing Fgf8 along the body axis before limb budding.RA–FGF8 antagonism has also been found to be essential for somitogenesis and neurogenesis during body axis extension. RA directly represses caudal Fgf8 through an upstream retinoic acid response element.Genetic loss of RA synthesis has identified several additional roles for RA signalling during organogenesis, including neuronal differentiation in the hindbrain and spinal cord, eye morphogenesis, differentiation of forebrain basal ganglia, heart development and spermatogenesis. The putative role of RA in these developmental processes has been backed up by the identification of target genes that both require RA for normal expression and have nearby functional retinoic acid response elements.Understanding the mechanism of RA-mediated activation and repression during development will benefit efforts to obtain differentiated cell types that are useful in regenerative medicine.},

	abstract = {During embryonic development, cells of metazoan embryos need to communicate in order to construct the correct bodyplan. To do so, they use several signals that usually act through interactions between ligands and receptors. Interestingly, only a few pathways are known to be fundamental during animal development, and they are usually found in all the major metazoan clades, raising the following question: how have evolution of the actors and of the functions of these pathways participated in the appearance of the current diversity of animal morphologies?  The chordate lineage comprises vertebrates, their sister group the urochordates, and the cephalochordates (i.e. amphioxus). Urochordates are quite derived relative to the chordate ancestor, whereas cephalochordates and vertebrates share many morphological traits. Thus, comparing embryonic development between vertebrates and cephalochordates should give us some insight into the ancestral characters present in chordates and into the morphological evolution in this clade. However, while much is known about the function of different signalling pathways in vertebrates, data are still scarce in the literature for cephalochordates. In this review, we summarize the current state of the field concerning the expression of actors and the function of the major cell-cell communication pathways, including Hedgehog (Hh), Notch, Nuclear Receptor (NR), Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK), Transforming Growth Factor-\&beta; (TGF-\&beta;) and Wingless/Int (Wnt), in amphioxus.},

With Wnts' evolutionarily conserved function as primordial symmetry breaking signals, these proteins and their downstream effects are responsible for simultaneously establishing cellular diversity and tissue organization. With their expansive repertoire of secreted agonists and antagonists, cell surface receptors, signaling cascades and downstream biological effects, Wnts are ideally suited to control the complex processes underlying vertebrate neural development.

The emergence of bilaterality was a major evolutionary transition, as it allowed animals to evolve more complex body plans. Therefore, how bilaterality evolved and whether it evolved once or several times independently is a fundamental issue in evolutionary developmental biology. Recent findings from non-bilaterian animals, in particular from Cnidaria, the sister group to Bilateria, have shed new light into the evolutionary origin of bilaterality. Here, we compare the molecular control of body axes in radially and bilaterally symmetric cnidarians and bilaterians, identify the minimal set of traits common for Bilateria, and evaluate whether bilaterality arose once or more than once during evolution.},

Across the diversity of Metazoa, there are only few conserved cell signalling pathways known to orchestrate the complex cell and tissue interactions regulating development; thus, modification to these few pathways has been responsible for generating diversity during the evolution of animals. Here, we summarize evidence for the origin and putative function of the intracellular, membrane-bound and secreted components of seven metazoan cell signalling pathways with a special focus on early branching metazoans (ctenophores, poriferans, placozoans and cnidarians) and basal unikonts (amoebozoans, fungi, filastereans and choanoflagellates). We highlight the modular incorporation of intra- and extracellular components in each signalling pathway and suggest that increases in the complexity of the extracellular matrix may have further promoted the modulation of cell signalling during metazoan evolution. Most importantly, this updated view of metazoan signalling pathways highlights the need for explicit study of canonical signalling pathway components in taxa that do not operate a complete signalling pathway. Studies like these are critical for developing a deeper understanding of the evolution of cell signalling.This article is part of the themed issue 'Evo-devo in the genomics era, and the origins of morphological diversity'.},

Upon gain or loss of activity of the SHH pathway, bones are gained, lost or malformed, and such deregulation underlies the aetiology of various human congenital limb defects. Likewise, accumulating evidence suggests that evolutionary tampering with SHH signaling underlies the morphological diversification of the tetrapod appendicular skeleton. This review summarizes the roles of the SHH pathway in the context of limb development and evolution and incorporates recent evidence into a mechanistic view of how the positioning of digit condensations is integrated with the specification of distinct bone morphologies.},

	abstract = {Gastrulation was arguably the key evolutionary innovation that enabled metazoan diversification, leading to the formation of distinct germ layers and specialized tissues. Differential gene expression specifying cell fate is governed by the inputs of intracellular and/or extracellular signals. Beta-catenin/Tcf and the TGF-beta bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) provide critical molecular signaling inputs during germ layer specification in bilaterian metazoans, but there has been no direct experimental evidence for a specific role for BMP signaling during endomesoderm specification in the early branching metazoan Nematostella vectensis (an anthozoan cnidarian). Using forward transcriptomics, we show that beta-catenin/Tcf signaling and BMP2/4 signaling provide differential inputs into the cnidarian endomesodermal gene regulatory network (GRN) at the onset of gastrulation (24 h postfertilization) in N. vectensis. Surprisingly, beta-catenin/Tcf signaling and BMP2/4 signaling regulate a subset of common downstream target genes in the GRN in opposite ways, leading to the spatial and temporal differentiation of fields of cells in the developing embryo. Thus, we show that regulatory interactions between beta-catenin/Tcf signaling and BMP2/4 signaling are required for the specification and determination of different embryonic regions and the patterning of the oral–aboral axis in Nematostella. We also show functionally that the conserved “kernel” of the bilaterian heart mesoderm GRN is operational in N. vectensis, which reinforces the hypothesis that the endoderm and mesoderm in triploblastic bilaterians evolved from the bifunctional endomesoderm (gastrodermis) of a diploblastic ancestor, and that slow rhythmic contractions might have been one of the earliest functions of mesodermal tissue.},

This depends on specific cis-regulatory elements distributed in the noncoding DNA surrounding their target genes. Studies performed on mammalian embryonic stem cells and Drosophila embryos suggest that active enhancers form part of a defined chromatin landscape marked by histone H3 lysine 4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1) and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac). Nevertheless, little is known about the dynamics and the potential roles of these marks during vertebrate embryogenesis. Here, we provide genomic maps of H3K4me1/me3 and H3K27ac at four developmental time-points of zebrafish embryogenesis and analyze embryonic enhancer activity. We find that (1) changes in H3K27ac enrichment at enhancers accompany the shift from pluripotency to tissue-specific gene expression, (2) in early embryos, the peaks of H3K27ac enrichment are bound by pluripotent factors such as Nanog, and (3) the degree of evolutionary conservation is higher for enhancers that become marked by H3K27ac at the end of gastrulation, suggesting their implication in the establishment of the most conserved (phylotypic) transcriptome that is known to occur later at the pharyngula stage.},

	abstract = {Among the developmental processes that have been proposed to influence the direction of evolution, the modular organization of developmental gene regulatory networks (GRNs) has shown particular promise. In theory, GRNs have core modules comprised of essential, conserved circuits of genes, and sub-modules of downstream, secondary circuits of genes that are more susceptible to variation. While this idea has received considerable interest as of late, the field of evo-devo lacks the experimental systems needed to rigorously evaluate this hypothesis. Here, we introduce an experimental system, the vertebrate tooth, that has great potential as a model for testing this hypothesis. Tooth development and its associated GRN have been well studied and modeled in both model and non-model organisms. We propose that the existence of modules within the tooth GRN explains both the conservation of developmental mechanisms and the extraordinary diversity of teeth among vertebrates. Based on experimental data, we hypothesize that there is a conserved core module of genes that is absolutely necessary to ensure tooth or cusp initiation and development. In regard to tooth shape variation between species, we suggest that more relaxed sub-modules activated at later steps of tooth development, for example, during the morphogenesis of the tooth and its cusps, control the different axes of tooth morphological variation.},

A notable feature of the paleontological record of animal evolution is the establishment by the Early “Cambrian of virtually all phylum-level body plans. We identify a class of GRN component, the kernels” of the network, which, because of their developmental role and their particular internal structure, are most impervious to change. Conservation of phyletic body plans may have been due to the retention since pre-Cambrian time of GRN kernels, which underlie development of major body parts.},

In the present study, we assembled two chromosome-level genomes, one each for wild yak and domestic yak, and screened structural variants (SVs) through the long-read data of yak and taurine cattle. The results revealed that 6733 genes contained high-FST SVs. 127 genes carrying special type of SVs were differentially expressed in lungs of the taurine cattle and yak. We then constructed the first single-cell gene expression atlas of yak and taurine cattle lung tissues and identified a yak-specific endothelial cell subtype. By integrating SVs and single-cell transcriptome data, we revealed that the endothelial cells expressed the highest proportion of marker genes carrying high-FST SVs in taurine cattle lungs. Furthermore, we identified pathways which were related to the medial thickness and formation of elastic fibers in yak lungs. These findings provide new insights into the high-altitude adaptation of yak and have important implications for understanding the physiological and pathological responses of large mammals and humans to hypoxia.},

This has resulted in a wealth of studies describing the developmental roles of DNA methylation in various vertebrate model systems. It is now evident that in certain contexts DNA methylation can act as a key regulator of cell identity establishment, whereas in many other cases the quantity of DNA methylation will merely reflect other upstream regulatory changes. For example, a number of studies have indicated that DNA methylation might be dispensable for pluripotency stages of embryonic development. Nevertheless, targeted deposition and removal of DNA methylation by DNMTs and TET proteins, respectively, appears to be required for vertebrate gastrulation. Here we review the roles of DNA methylation in the establishment and maintenance of cell identity during development, with a special emphasis on insights obtained from in vivo studies.},

	abstract = {DNA methylation is of paramount importance for mammalian embryonic development. DNA methylation has numerous functions: it is implicated in the repression of transposons and genes, but is also associated with actively transcribed gene bodies and, in some cases, with gene activation per se. In recent years, sensitive technologies have been developed that allow the interrogation of DNA methylation patterns from a small number of cells. The use of these technologies has greatly improved our knowledge of DNA methylation dynamics and heterogeneity in embryos and in specific tissues. Combined with genetic analyses, it is increasingly apparent that regulation of DNA methylation erasure and (re-)establishment varies considerably between different developmental stages. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms and functions of DNA methylation and demethylation in both mice and humans at CpG-rich promoters, gene bodies and transposable elements. We highlight the dynamic erasure and re-establishment of DNA methylation in embryonic, germline and somatic cell development. Finally, we provide insights into DNA methylation gained from studying genetic diseases.},

	abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) are key proteins that decode the information in our genome to express a precise and unique set of proteins and RNA molecules in each cell type in our body. These factors play a pivotal role in all biological processes, including the determination of a cell's fate during development and the maintenance of a cell's physiological function. To achieve this, a TF binds to specific DNA sequences in the noncoding part of the genome, recruits chromatin modifiers and cofactors, and directs the transcription initiation rate of its “target genes.” Therefore, a key challenge in deciphering a transcriptional switch is to identify the direct target genes of the master regulators that control the switch, the cis-regulatory elements implementing (auto-)regulatory loops, and the target genes of all the TFs in the downstream regulatory network. A better knowledge of a TF's targetome during specification and differentiation of a particular cell type will generate mechanistic insight into its developmental program. Here, I review computational strategies and methods to predict transcriptional targets by genome-wide searches for TF binding sites using position weight matrices, motif clusters, phylogenetic footprinting, chromatin binding and accessibility data, enhancer classification, motif enrichment, and gene expression signatures.},

Until recently, the identification of such direct target genes has relied on a combination of expression analysis and in silico searches for consensus binding motifs in gene promoters. Consensus binding motifs for transcription factors are often defined using in vitro DNA binding strategies. Such in vitro strategies fail to account for the many factors that contribute significantly to target selection by transcription factors in cells beyond the recognition of these short consensus DNA sequences. These factors include DNA methylation, chromatin structure, posttranslational modifications of transcription factors, and the cooperative recruitment of transcription factor complexes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) provides a means of isolating transcription factor complexes in the context of endogenous chromatin, allowing the identification of direct transcription factor targets. ChIP can be combined with site-specific PCR for candidate binding sites or alternatively with cloning, genomic microarrays or more recently direct high throughput sequencing to identify novel genomic targets. The application of ChIP-based approaches has redefined consensus binding motifs for transcription factors and provided important insights into transcription factor biology.},

Typical patterns of histone methylations exhibited at promoters, insulators, enhancers, and transcribed regions are identified. The monomethylations of H3K27, H3K9, H4K20, H3K79, and H2BK5 are all linked to gene activation, whereas trimethylations of H3K27, H3K9, and H3K79 are linked to repression. H2A.Z associates with functional regulatory elements, and CTCF marks boundaries of histone methylation domains. Chromosome banding patterns are correlated with unique patterns of histone modifications. Chromosome breakpoints detected in T cell cancers frequently reside in chromatin regions associated with H3K4 methylations.

PRC2-catalyzed histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) is recognized by distinct classes of effectors such as canonical PRC1 and BAH module-containing proteins (notably BAHCC1 in human). These effectors mediate gene silencing by different mechanisms including phase separation-related chromatin compaction and histone deacetylation. We discuss recent advances in understanding the structural architecture of PRC2, the regulation of its activity and chromatin recruitment, and the molecular mechanisms underlying Polycomb-mediated gene silencing.

Identification of active gene regulatory elements is a key to understanding transcriptional control governing biological processes such as cell-type specificity, differentiation, development, proliferation, and response to the environment. Mapping DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites has historically been a valuable tool for identifying all different types of regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, and locus control regions. This method utilizes DNase I to selectively digest nucleosome-depleted DNA (presumably by transcription factors), whereas DNA regions tightly wrapped in nucleosome and higher-order structures are more resistant. The traditional low-throughput method for identifying DNase I HS sites uses Southern blots. Here, we describe the complete and improved protocol for DNase-seq, a high-throughput method that identifies DNase I HS sites across the whole genome by capturing DNase-digested fragments and sequencing them by high-throughput, next-generation sequencing. In a single experiment, DNase-seq can identify most active regulatory regions from potentially any cell type, from any species with a sequenced genome.},

As master regulators of enhancer activation, pioneers are thus crucial for the implementation of correct cell fate decisions in development, and as such, they hold tremendous potential for therapy through cellular reprogramming. The power of pioneer factors to reshape the epigenome also presents an Achilles heel, as their misexpression has major pathological consequences, such as in cancer.

	abstract = {Summary A major challenge in biology is to understand how complex gene expression patterns are encoded in the genome. While transcriptional enhancers have been studied extensively, few transcriptional silencers have been identified, and they remain poorly understood. Here, we used a novel strategy to screen hundreds of sequences for tissue-specific silencer activity in whole Drosophila embryos. Almost all of the transcriptional silencers that we identified were also active enhancers in other cellular contexts. These elements are bound by more transcription factors than non-silencers. A subset of these silencers forms long-range contacts with promoters. Deletion of a silencer caused derepression of its target gene. Our results challenge the common practice of treating enhancers and silencers as separate classes of regulatory elements and suggest the possibility that thousands or more bifunctional CRMs remain to be discovered in Drosophila and 104–105 in humans.},

	abstract = {Silencers are regulatory DNA elements that reduce transcription from their target promoters; they are the repressive counterparts of enhancers. Although discovered decades ago, and despite evidence of their importance in development and disease, silencers have been much less studied than enhancers. Recently, however, a series of papers have reported systematic studies of silencers in various model systems. Silencers are often bifunctional regulatory elements that can also act as enhancers, depending on cellular context, and are enriched for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and disease-associated variants. There is not yet evidence of a ‘silencer chromatin signature’, in the distribution of histone modifications or associated proteins, that is common to all silencers; instead, silencers may fall into various subclasses, acting by distinct (and possibly overlapping) mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Recent studies of the genome architecture of vertebrates have uncovered two unforeseen aspects of its organization. First, large regions of the genome, called gene deserts, are devoid of protein-coding sequences and have no obvious biological role. Second, comparative genomics has highlighted the existence of an array of highly conserved non-coding regions (HCNRs) in all vertebrates. Most surprisingly, these structural features are strongly associated with genes that have essential functions during development. Among these, the vertebrate Iroquois (Irx) genes stand out on both fronts. Mammalian Irx genes are organized in two clusters (IrxA and IrxB) that span {\textgreater}1 Mb each with no other genes interspersed. Additionally, a large number of HCNRs exist within Irx clusters. We have systematically examined the enhancer activity of HCNRs from the IrxB cluster using transgenic Xenopus and zebrafish embryos. Most of these HCNRs are active in subdomains of endogenous Irx expression, and some are candidates to contain shared enhancers of neighboring genes, which could explain the evolutionary conservation of Irx clusters. Furthermore, HCNRs present in tetrapod IrxB but not in fish may be responsible for novel Irx expression domains that appeared after their divergence. Finally, we have performed a more detailed analysis on two IrxB ultraconserved non-coding regions (UCRs) duplicated in IrxA clusters in similar relative positions. These four regions share a core region highly conserved among all of them and drive expression in similar domains. However, inter-species conserved sequences surrounding the core, specific for each of these UCRs, are able to modulate their expression.},

	abstract = {Unequivocal identification of the full composition of a gene is made difficult by the cryptic nature of regulatory elements. Regulatory elements are notoriously difficult to locate and may reside at considerable distances from the transcription units on which they operate and, moreover, may be incorporated into the structure of neighbouring genes. The importance of regulatory mutations as the basis of human abnormalities remains obscure. Here, we show that the chromosome 7q36 associated preaxial polydactyly, a frequently observed congenital limb malformation, results from point mutations in a Shh regulatory element. Shh, normally expressed in the ZPA posteriorly in the limb bud, is expressed in an additional ectopic site at the anterior margin in mouse models of PPD. Our investigations into the basis of the ectopic Shh expression identified the enhancer element that drives normal Shh expression in the ZPA. The regulator, designated ZRS, lies within intron 5 of the Lmbr1 gene 1 Mb from the target gene Shh. The ZRS drives the early spatio-temporal expression pattern in the limb of tetrapods. Despite the morphological differences between limbs and fins, an equivalent regulatory element is found in fish. The ZRS contains point mutations that segregate with polydactyly in four unrelated families with PPD and in the Hx mouse mutant. Thus point mutations residing in long-range regulatory elements are capable of causing congenital abnormalities, and possess the capacity to modify gene activity such that a novel gamut of abnormalities is detected.},

In this Review, we discuss the defining properties of gene core promoters, including their sequence features, chromatin architecture and transcription initiation patterns. We provide an overview of molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of core promoters and their emerging functional diversity, which defines distinct transcription programmes. On the basis of the established properties of gene core promoters, we discuss transcription start sites within enhancers and integrate recent results obtained from dedicated functional assays to propose a functional model of transcription initiation. This model can explain the nature and function of transcription initiation at gene starts and at enhancers and can explain the different roles of core promoters, of Pol II and its associated factors and of the activating cues provided by enhancers and the transcription factors and cofactors they recruit.},

Here we develop a high-quality reference genome assembly for threespine sticklebacks. By sequencing the genomes of twenty additional individuals from a global set of marine and freshwater populations, we identify a genome-wide set of loci that are consistently associated with marine–freshwater divergence. Our results indicate that reuse of globally shared standing genetic variation, including chromosomal inversions, has an important role in repeated evolution of distinct marine and freshwater sticklebacks, and in the maintenance of divergent ecotypes during early stages of reproductive isolation. Both coding and regulatory changes occur in the set of loci underlying marine–freshwater evolution, but regulatory changes appear to predominate in this well known example of repeated adaptive evolution in nature.},

Here, we demonstrate in macrophages and B cells that collaborative interactions of the common factor PU.1 with small sets of macrophage- or B cell lineage-determining transcription factors establish cell-specific binding sites that are associated with the majority of promoter-distal H3K4me1-marked genomic regions. PU.1 binding initiates nucleosome remodeling, followed by H3K4 monomethylation at large numbers of genomic regions associated with both broadly and specifically expressed genes. These locations serve as beacons for additional factors, exemplified by liver X receptors, which drive both cell-specific gene expression and signal-dependent responses. Together with analyses of transcription factor binding and H3K4me1 patterns in other cell types, these studies suggest that simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors can specify the genomic sites ultimately responsible for both cell identity and cell type-specific responses to diverse signaling inputs. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

For sequences that lie within enhancers or promoters of transcription, it is not straightforward to assess the effects of variants on likely transcription factor binding sites. Consequently we introduce motifbreakR, which allows the biologist to judge whether the sequence surrounding a polymorphism or mutation is a good match, and how much information is gained or lost in one allele of the polymorphism or mutation relative to the other. MotifbreakR is flexible, giving a choice of algorithms for interrogation of genomes with motifs from many public sources that users can choose from. MotifbreakR can predict effects for novel or previously described variants in public databases, making it suitable for tasks beyond the scope of its original design.

We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The DESeq2 package is available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html.},

GREAT incorporates annotations from 20 ontologies and is available as a web application. Applying GREAT to data sets from chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) of multiple transcription-associated factors, including SRF, NRSF, GABP, Stat3 and p300 in different developmental contexts, we recover many functions of these factors that are missed by existing gene-based tools, and we generate testable hypotheses.

Here we sequence the genome of the Mediterranean amphioxus (Branchiostoma lanceolatum) and characterize DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, histone modifications and transcriptomes across multiple developmental stages and adult tissues to investigate the evolution of the regulation of the chordate genome. Comparisons with vertebrates identify an intermediate stage in the evolution of differentially methylated enhancers, and a high conservation of gene expression and its cis-regulatory logic between amphioxus and vertebrates that occurs maximally at an earlier mid-embryonic phylotypic period. We analyse regulatory evolution after whole-genome duplications, and find that—in vertebrates—over 80\% of broadly expressed gene families with multiple paralogues derived from whole-genome duplications have members that restricted their ancestral expression, and underwent specialization rather than subfunctionalization. Counter-intuitively, paralogues that restricted their expression increased the complexity of their regulatory landscapes.

However, how this regulation is encoded in the messenger RNA sequence remains largely unknown. Here we uncover unique RNA regulons embedded in homeobox (Hox) 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs) that confer ribosome-mediated control of gene expression. These structured RNA elements, resembling viral internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), are found in subsets of Hox mRNAs. They facilitate ribosome recruitment and require the ribosomal protein RPL38 for their activity. Despite numerous layers of Hox gene regulation, these IRES elements are essential for converting Hox transcripts into proteins to pattern the mammalian body plan. This specialized mode of IRES-dependent translation is enabled by an additional regulatory element that we term the translation inhibitory element (TIE), which blocks cap-dependent translation of transcripts. Together, these data uncover a new paradigm for ribosome-mediated control of gene expression and organismal development.},

To date, hundreds of different RNA modifications have been characterized. Among them, several RNA modifications, including N6-methyladenosine (m6A), N6,2′-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxoG), pseudouridine (Ψ), 5-methylcytidine (m5C), and N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C), have been shown to regulate mRNA stability, consequently affecting diverse cellular and biological processes.

	abstract = {Modularity and hierarchy are important theoretical concepts in biology, and both are useful frameworks to understand the evolution of complex systems. Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) provide a powerful mechanistic model for modularity in animal development, as they are made up of modular (or self-contained) circuits, which are deployed in a hierarchical manner over time. Over the years, studies in the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, have provided an illustrative example of how these regulatory circuits are responsible for processes such as cell differentiation and cell state specificity. However, GRNs are themselves made up of a nested series of interactions, as each gene can be regulated by multiple cis-regulatory elements, which can be further broken down into distinct transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). As a result, modularity can be applied to each “level” of this complex hierarchy. Throughout the literature, there is considerable discussion about the roles modular circuits, modular enhancers, and modular TFBS play in evolution, yet there is little discussion about how these nested interactions operate as a whole. In this chapter, we discuss how modular changes at different levels of the GRN hierarchy affect animal development and aim to provide a unified framework to understand the role of modularity in evolution.},

However, the speed of cave adaptation in some species suggests mechanisms operating over shorter timescales. To address these mechanisms, we used \textit{Astyanax mexicanus}, a teleost with ancestral surface morphs (surface fish, SF) and derived cave morphs (cavefish, CF). We exposed SF to completely dark conditions and identified numerous altered traits at both the gene expression and phenotypic levels. Remarkably, most of these alterations mimicked CF phenotypes. Our results indicate that many cave-related traits can appear within a single generation by phenotypic plasticity. In the next generation, plasticity can be further refined. The initial plastic responses are random in adaptive outcome but may determine the subsequent course of evolution.

	abstract = {The PHylogenetic Analysis with Space/Time models (PHAST) software package consists of a collection of command-line programs and supporting libraries for comparative genomics. PHAST is best known as the engine behind the Conservation tracks in the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser. However, it also includes several other tools for phylogenetic modeling and functional element identification, as well as utilities for manipulating alignments, trees and genomic annotations. PHAST has been in development since 2002 and has now been downloaded more than 1000 times, but so far it has been released only as provisional (‘beta’) software. Here, we describe the first official release (v1.0) of PHAST, with improved stability, portability and documentation and several new features. We outline the components of the package and detail recent improvements. In addition, we introduce a new interface to the PHAST libraries from the R statistical computing environment, called RPHAST, and illustrate its use in a series of vignettes. We demonstrate that RPHAST can be particularly useful in applications involving both large-scale phylogenomics and complex statistical analyses. The R interface also makes the PHAST libraries acccessible to non-C programmers, and is useful for rapid prototyping. PHAST v1.0 and RPHAST v1.0 are available for download at http://compgen.bscb.cornell.edu/phast, under the terms of an unrestrictive BSD-style license. RPHAST can also be obtained from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN; http://cran.r-project.org).},

	abstract = {Reproducibility is essential to reliable scientific discovery in high-throughput experiments. In this work we propose a unified approach to measure the reproducibility of findings identified from replicate experiments and identify putative discoveries using reproducibility. Unlike the usual scalar measures of reproducibility, our approach creates a curve, which quantitatively assesses when the findings are no longer consistent across replicates. Our curve is fitted by a copula mixture model, from which we derive a quantitative reproducibility score, which we call the “irreproducible discovery rate” (IDR) analogous to the FDR. This score can be computed at each set of paired replicate ranks and permits the principled setting of thresholds both for assessing reproducibility and combining replicates. Since our approach permits an arbitrary scale for each replicate, it provides useful descriptive measures in a wide variety of situations to be explored. We study the performance of the algorithm using simulations and give a heuristic analysis of its theoretical properties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in a ChIP-seq experiment.},

However, some of the body part homologies between amphioxus and vertebrates have been controversial. This is not surprising as the amphioxus and vertebrate lineages separated half a billion years ago–plenty of time for independent loss and independent gain of features. The development of new techniques in the late 20th and early 21st centuries including transmission electron microscopy and serial blockface scanning electron microscopy in combination with in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry to reveal spatio-temporal patterns of gene expression and gene products have greatly strengthened inference of some homologies (like those between regions of the central nervous system), although others (like nephridia) still need further support. These major advances in establishing homologies between amphioxus and vertebrates, together with strong support from comparative genomics, have firmly established amphioxus as a stand-in or model for the ancestral vertebrate.},

Here we show that eyespots likely originated via cooption of parts of an ancestral appendage gene-regulatory network (GRN) to novel locations on the wing. Using comparative transcriptome analysis, we show that eyespots cluster most closely with antennae, relative to multiple other tissues. Furthermore, three genes essential for eyespot development, Distal-less (Dll), spalt (sal), and Antennapedia (Antp), share similar regulatory connections as those observed in the antennal GRN. CRISPR knockout of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) for Dll and sal led to the loss of eyespots, antennae, legs, and also wings, demonstrating that these CREs are highly pleiotropic. We conclude that eyespots likely reused an ancient GRN for their development, a network also previously implicated in the development of antennae, legs, and wings.},

	abstract = {Ornamentation, such as the showy plumage of birds, is widespread among female vertebrates, yet the evolutionary pressures shaping female ornamentation remain uncertain. In part this is due to a poor understanding of the mechanistic route to ornamentation in females. To address this issue, we evaluated the evolutionary history of ornament expression in a tropical passerine bird, the White‐shouldered Fairywren, whose females, but not males, strongly vary between populations in occurrence of ornamented black‐and‐white plumage. We first use phylogenomic analysis to demonstrate that female ornamentation is derived and that female ornamentation evolves independently of changes in male plumage. We then use exogenous testosterone in a field experiment to induce partial ornamentation in naturally unornamented females. By sequencing the transcriptome of experimentally induced ornamented and natural feathers, we identify genes expressed during ornament production and evaluate the degree to which female ornamentation in this system is associated with elevated testosterone, as is common in males. We reveal that some ornamentation in females is linked to testosterone and that sexes differ in ornament‐linked gene expression. Lastly, using genomic outlier analysis we identify a candidate melanogenesis gene that lies in a region of high genomic divergence among populations that is also differentially expressed in feather follicles of different female plumages. Taken together, these findings are consistent with sex‐specific selection favoring the evolution of female ornaments and demonstrate a key role for testosterone in generating population divergence in female ornamentation through gene regulation. More broadly, our work highlights similarities and differences in how ornamentation evolves in the sexes.},

This diversity of functions relies on the fact that vertebrates possess the largest FGF gene complement among metazoans. In the cephalochordate amphioxus, which belongs to the chordate clade together with vertebrates and tunicates, we have previously shown that the main role of FGF during early development is the control of rostral somite formation. Inhibition of this signalling pathway induces the loss of these structures, resulting in an embryo without anterior segmented mesoderm, as in the vertebrate head. Here, by combining several approaches, we show that the anterior presumptive paraxial mesoderm cells acquire an anterior axial fate when FGF signal is inhibited and that they are later incorporated in the anterior notochord. Our analysis of notochord formation in wild type and in embryos in which FGF signalling is inhibited also reveals that amphioxus anterior notochord presents transient prechordal plate features. Altogether, our results give insight into how changes in FGF functions during chordate evolution might have participated to the emergence of the complex vertebrate head.},

The amphioxus, or lancelets, are benthic filter feeding marine animals and their interest as a model in research is due to their phylogenetic position and their anatomical and genetic stasis throughout their evolutionary history. From the first works in the 19th century to the present day, enormous progress is made mainly favored by technical development at different levels, from spawning induction and husbandry techniques, through techniques for studies of gene function or of the role of different signalling pathways through embryonic development, to functional genomics techniques. Together, these advances foretell a plethora of interesting developments in the world of research with the amphioxus model.

In mice, a single enhancer termed ZRS is solely responsible for Shh expression in limbs. Here, zebrafish and mouse transgenic assays trace the functional equivalence of ZRS across the gnathostome phylogeny. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of the medaka (Oryzias latipes) ZRS and enhancer assays identify the existence of ZRS shadow enhancers in both teleost and human genomes. Deletion of both ZRS and shadow ZRS abolishes shh expression and completely truncates pectoral fin formation. Strikingly, deletion of ZRS results in an almost complete ablation of the dorsal fin. This finding indicates that a ZRS-Shh regulatory module is shared by paired and median fins and that paired fins likely emerged by the co-option of developmental programs established in the median fins of stem gnathostomes. Shh function was later reinforced in pectoral fin development with the recruitment of shadow enhancers, conferring additional robustness.},

	abstract = {The appearance of novel anatomic structures during evolution is driven by changes to the networks of transcription factors, signaling pathways, and downstream effector genes controlling development. The nature of the changes to these developmental gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is poorly understood. A striking test case is the evolution of the GRN controlling development of the neural crest (NC). NC cells emerge from the neural plate border (NPB) and contribute to multiple adult structures. While all chordates have a NPB, only in vertebrates do NPB cells express all the genes constituting the neural crest GRN (NC-GRN). Interestingly, invertebrate chordates express orthologs of NC-GRN components in other tissues, revealing that during vertebrate evolution new regulatory connections emerged between transcription factors primitively expressed in the NPB and genes primitively expressed in other tissues. Such interactions could have evolved by two mechanisms. First, transcription factors primitively expressed in the NPB may have evolved new DNA and/or cofactor binding properties (protein neofunctionalization). Alternately, cis-regulatory elements driving NPB expression may have evolved near genes primitively expressed in other tissues (cis-regulatory neofunctionalization). Here we discuss how gene duplication can, in principle, promote either form of neofunctionalization. We review recent published examples of interspecies gene-swap, or regulatory-element-swap, experiments that test both models. Such experiments have yielded little evidence to support the importance of protein neofunctionalization in the emergence of the NC-GRN, but do support the importance of novel cis-regulatory elements in this process. The NC-GRN is an excellent model for the study of gene regulatory and macroevolutionary innovation. genesis 51:457–470. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

However, the role of neural crest cells in cavefish evolution and development is poorly understood. One of the reasons is that experimental methods for neural crest analysis are not well developed in the Astyanax system. Here we describe neural crest transplantation between Astyanax surface fish and cavefish embryos. We found differences in the migration of cranial neural crest cells transplanted from the surface fish anterior hindbrain to the same region of surface fish or cavefish hosts. Cranial neural crest cells migrated extensively throughout the head, and to a lesser extent the trunk, in surface fish hosts but their migration was mostly restricted to the anterior and dorsal head regions in cavefish hosts. Cranial neural crest cells derived from the surface fish transplants invaded the degenerating eyes of cavefish hosts, resulting in increased eye size and suggesting that cavefish neural crest cells are defective in forming optic derivatives. We found that melanophores were formed in albino cavefish from grafts of surface fish trunk neural crest cells, showing that the cavefish tissue environment is conducive for pigment cell development, and implicating intrinsic changes in cavefish neural crest cells in loss of body pigmentation. It is concluded that changes in neural crest cells play key roles in the evolution of cavefish development.},

These cells arise within the dorsal ectoderm of all vertebrate embryos and have the developmental potential to form many of the morphological novelties within the vertebrate head. Each cell population has its own distinct developmental features and generates unique cell types. However, it is essential that neural crest and placodes associate together throughout embryonic development to coordinate the emergence of several features in the head, including almost all of the cranial peripheral sensory nervous system and organs of special sense. Despite the significance of this developmental feat, its evolutionary origins have remained unclear, owing largely to the fact that there has been little comparative (evolutionary) work done on this topic between the jawed vertebrates and cyclostomes—the jawless lampreys and hagfishes. In this review, we briefly summarize the developmental mechanisms and genetics of neural crest and placodes in both jawed and jawless vertebrates. We then discuss recent studies on the role of neural crest and placodes—and their developmental association—in the head of lamprey embryos, and how comparisons with jawed vertebrates can provide insights into the causes and consequences of this event in early vertebrate evolution.},

Here we present a high-resolution, chromosome-level surface fish genome, enabling the first genome-wide comparison between surface fish and cavefish populations. Using this resource, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping analyses and found new candidate genes for eye loss such as dusp26. We used CRISPR gene editing in A. mexicanus to confirm the essential role of a gene within an eye size QTL, rx3, in eye formation. We also generated the first genome-wide evaluation of deletion variability across cavefish populations to gain insight into this potential source of cave adaptation. The surface fish genome reference now provides a more complete resource for comparative, functional and genetic studies of drastic trait differences within a species., Mexican Tetra cavefish have long been of interest in understanding adaptation to severe environmental change.

According to the ‘a new heart for a new head’ hypothesis, the evolution of the cardiopharyngeal gene regulatory network appears as a pivotal aspect to understand the evolution of the lifestyles of chordates2–4. Here we show that appendicularians experienced massive ancestral losses of cardiopharyngeal genes and subfunctions, leading to the ‘deconstruction’ of two ancestral modules of the tunicate cardiopharyngeal gene regulatory network. In ascidians, these modules are related to early and late multipotency, which is involved in lineage cell-fate determination towards the first and second heart fields and siphon muscles. Our work shows that the deconstruction of the cardiopharyngeal gene regulatory network involved the regressive loss of the siphon muscle, supporting an evolutionary scenario in which ancestral tunicates had a sessile ascidian-like adult lifestyle. In agreement with this scenario, our findings also suggest that this deconstruction contributed to the acceleration of cardiogenesis and the redesign of the heart into an open-wide laminar structure in appendicularians as evolutionary adaptations during their transition to a complete pelagic free-living style upon the innovation of the food-filtering house5.},

Here, we analysed the embryonic transcriptomes of surface-dwelling and blind cave-adapted morphs of the species Astyanax mexicanus and their reciprocal F1 hybrids at tailbud stage. Comparing gene expression in parents and allelic expression ratios in hybrids, we found that ∼20\% of the transcriptome is differentially expressed and that cis-regulatory changes are the main contributors to variations in early developmental gene expression in the two morphs. We provide a list of 108 cis-regulated genes that could contribute to cavefish developmental evolution, and further explore the regulatory mechanisms controlling the cellular and regional expression of rx3, a “master eye gene”. Using quantitative embryology approaches after fluorescent in situ hybridisation, cell transplantations and interference with signalling pathways, we show that rx3 cellular levels -controlling optic cell fates-are regulated in cis and in a cell-autonomous manner, whereas the size of rx3 domain -controlling eye size-depends on non-autonomous Wnt signalling. Altogether, we reveal how distinct mechanisms and regulatory modules can regulate developmental gene expression and shape developmental evolution, with negligible contribution of coding mutations.},

For example, the number of vertebrate genome assemblies currently in the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database4 increased by more than 50\% to 1,485 assemblies in the year from July 2018 to July 2019. In addition to this influx of assemblies from different species, new human de novo assemblies5 are being produced, which enable the analysis of not only small polymorphisms, but also complex, large-scale structural differences between human individuals and haplotypes. This coming era and its unprecedented amount of data offer the opportunity to uncover many insights into genome evolution but also present challenges in how to adapt current analysis methods to meet the increased scale. Cactus6, a reference-free multiple genome alignment program, has been shown to be highly accurate, but the existing implementation scales poorly with increasing numbers of genomes, and struggles in regions of highly duplicated sequences. Here we describe progressive extensions to Cactus to create Progressive Cactus, which enables the reference-free alignment of tens to thousands of large vertebrate genomes while maintaining high alignment quality.

To examine cell-type diversity across and within species, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of {\textasciitilde}130,000 hypothalamic cells from zebrafish (Danio rerio) and surface and cave morphs of Mexican tetra (Astyanax mexicanus). We found that over 75\% of cell types were shared between zebrafish and Mexican tetra, which diverged from a common ancestor over 150 million years ago. Shared cell types displayed shifts in paralogue expression that were generated by subfunctionalization after genome duplication. Expression of terminal effector genes, such as neuropeptides, was more conserved than the expression of their associated transcriptional regulators. Species-specific cell types were enriched for the expression of species-specific genes and characterized by the neofunctionalization of expression patterns of members of recently expanded or contracted gene families. Comparisons between surface and cave morphs revealed differences in immune repertoires and transcriptional changes in neuropeptidergic cell types associated with genomic differences. The single-cell atlases presented here are a powerful resource to explore hypothalamic cell types and reveal how gene family evolution and shifts in paralogue expression contribute to cellular diversity.},

	abstract = {Proper cell fate determination is largely orchestrated by complex gene regulatory networks centered around transcription factors. However, experimental elucidation of key transcription factors that drive cellular identity is currently often intractable. Here, we present ANANSE (ANalysis Algorithm for Networks Specified by Enhancers), a network-based method that exploits enhancer-encoded regulatory information to identify the key transcription factors in cell fate determination. As cell type-specific transcription factors predominantly bind to enhancers, we use regulatory networks based on enhancer properties to prioritize transcription factors. First, we predict genome-wide binding profiles of transcription factors in various cell types using enhancer activity and transcription factor binding motifs. Subsequently, applying these inferred binding profiles, we construct cell type-specific gene regulatory networks, and then predict key transcription factors controlling cell fate transitions using differential networks between cell types. This method outperforms existing approaches in correctly predicting major transcription factors previously identified to be sufficient for trans-differentiation. Finally, we apply ANANSE to define an atlas of key transcription factors in 18 normal human tissues. In conclusion, we present a ready-to-implement computational tool for efficient prediction of transcription factors in cell fate determination and to study transcription factor-mediated regulatory mechanisms.

	abstract = {Biology and Evolution of the Mexican Cavefish features contributions by leading researchers in a comprehensive, unique work that examines a number of distinct areas of biology—evolution, development, ecology, and behavior—using the Mexican cavefish as a powerful model system to further understanding of basic biological processes such as eye degeneration, hearing, craniofacial development, sleep, and metabolic function.  These fish are currently being used to better understand a number of issues related to human health, including age-related blindness, sleep, obesity, mood-related disorders, and aging. The recent sequencing of the cavefish genome broadens the interest of this system to groups working with diverse biological systems, and has helped researchers identify genes that regulate sleep, eye degeneration, and metabolic function.  Mexican cavefish are particularly powerful for the study of biological processes because these fish evolved independently in twenty-nine caves in the Sierra de el Abra Region of Northeast Mexico. These fish have dramatic adaptations to the cave environment, and this can be used to identify genes involved in disease-related traits.  This scholarly text will be of interest to researchers and students throughout diverse areas of biology and ecology. It includes photographs of animals and behavior in laboratory and natural settings that will also increase interest and accessibility to non-experts. Includes a mixture of images and illustrations such as the geographical distribution of cave pools and the developmental biology of the nervous system Features a companion site with geographical maps  Fills a notable gap in the literature on a topic of broad interest to the scientific community Presents the recent sequencing of the cavefish genome as a groundbreaking development for researchers working with diverse biological systems},

Here we examine circadian clock function in Mexican blind cavefish Astyanax mexicanus and its surface counterpart. In the lab, adult surface fish show robust circadian rhythms in per1, which are retained in cave populations, but with substantial alterations. These changes may be due to increased levels of light-inducible genes in cavefish, including clock repressor per2. From a molecular standpoint, cavefish appear as if they experience ‘constant light’ rather than perpetual darkness. Micos River samples show similar per1 oscillations to those in the lab. However, data from Chica Cave shows complete repression of clock function, while expression of several light-responsive genes is raised, including DNA repair genes. We propose that altered expression of light-inducible genes provides a selective advantage to cavefish at the expense of a damped circadian oscillator.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms are nearly ubiquitous throughout nature, suggesting they are critical for survival in diverse environments. Organisms inhabiting largely arrhythmic environments, such as caves, offer a unique opportunity to study the evolution of circadian rhythms in response to changing ecological pressures. Populations of the Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, have repeatedly invaded caves from surface rivers, where individuals must contend with perpetual darkness, reduced food availability, and limited fluctuations in daily environmental cues. To investigate the molecular basis for evolved changes in circadian rhythms, we investigated rhythmic transcription across multiple independently-evolved cavefish populations. Our findings reveal that evolution in a cave environment has led to the repeated disruption of the endogenous biological clock, and its entrainment by light. The circadian transcriptome shows widespread reductions and losses of rhythmic transcription and changes to the timing of the activation/repression of core-transcriptional clock. In addition to dysregulation of the core clock, we find that rhythmic transcription of the melatonin regulator aanat2 and melatonin rhythms are disrupted in cavefish under darkness. Mutants of aanat2 and core clock gene rorca disrupt diurnal regulation of sleep in A. mexicanus, phenocopying circadian modulation of sleep and activity phenotypes of cave populations. Together, these findings reveal multiple independent mechanisms for loss of circadian rhythms in cavefish populations and provide a platform for studying how evolved changes in the biological clock can contribute to variation in sleep and circadian behavior.},

In this review we focus on the role of TFs as a link between signaling pathways and gene regulation. Cell signaling tends to result in the modulation of a set of TFs that then lead to changes in the cell's transcriptional program. We highlight the molecular layers at which TF activity can be measured and the associated technical and conceptual challenges. These layers include post-translational modifications (PTMs) of the TF, regulation of TF binding to DNA through chromatin accessibility and epigenetics, and expression of target genes. We highlight that a large number of TFs are understudied in both signaling and gene regulation studies, and that our knowledge about known TF targets has a strong literature bias. We argue that TFs serve as a perfect bridge between the fields of gene regulation and signaling, and that separating these fields hinders our understanding of cell functions. Multi-omics approaches that measure multiple dimensions of TF activity are ideally suited to study the interplay of cell signaling and gene regulation using TFs as the anchor to link the two fields.},

Furthermore, we probe the regulons of different cell populations, which include transcription factors and receptor-ligand interactions and reveal unique directional signalling between ocular cell types. In addition, we study conservation of regulons across vertebrates and zebrafish to identify common core factors.

We generated HARs and chimpanzee accelerated regions with the largest alignment of mammalian genomes to date. To facilitate exploration of accelerated evolution in other lineages, we implemented an open-source Nextflow pipeline that runs on any computing platform. Combining deep-learning with chromatin capture experiments in human and chimpanzee neural progenitor cells, we discovered a significant enrichment of HARs in topologically associating domains (TADs) containing human-specific genomic variants that change three-dimensional (3D) genome organization. Differential gene expression between humans and chimpanzees at these loci in multiple cell types suggests rewiring of regulatory interactions between HARs and neurodevelopmental genes. Thus, comparative genomics together with models of 3D genome folding revealed enhancer hijacking as an explanation for the rapid evolution of HARs.

	abstract = {The molecular events leading to the development of the bat wing remain largely unknown, and are thought to be caused, in part, by changes in gene expression during limb development. These expression changes could be instigated by variations in gene regulatory enhancers. Here, we used a comparative genomics approach to identify regions that evolved rapidly in the bat ancestor, but are highly conserved in other vertebrates. We discovered 166 bat accelerated regions (BARs) that overlap H3K27ac and p300 ChIP-seq peaks in developing mouse limbs. Using a mouse enhancer assay, we show that five Myotis lucifugus BARs drive gene expression in the developing mouse limb, with the majority showing differential enhancer activity compared to the mouse orthologous BAR sequences. These include BAR116, which is located telomeric to the HoxD cluster and had robust forelimb expression for the M. lucifugus sequence and no activity for the mouse sequence at embryonic day 12.5. Developing limb expression analysis of Hoxd10-Hoxd13 in Miniopterus natalensis bats showed a high-forelimb weak-hindlimb expression for Hoxd10-Hoxd11, similar to the expression trend observed for M. lucifugus BAR116 in mice, suggesting that it could be involved in the regulation of the bat HoxD complex. Combined, our results highlight novel regulatory regions that could be instrumental for the morphological differences leading to the development of the bat wing.},

	abstract = {Background: An emerging cavefish model, the cyprinid genus Sinocyclocheilus, is endemic to the massive southwestern karst area adjacent to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of China. In order to understand whether orogeny influenced the evolution of these species, and how genomes change under isolation, especially in subterranean habitats, we performed whole-genome sequencing and comparative analyses of three species in this genus, S. grahami, S. rhinocerous and S. anshuiensis. These species are surface-dwelling, semi-cave-dwelling and cave-restricted, respectively. Results: The assembled genome sizes of S. grahami, S. rhinocerous and S. anshuiensis are 1.75 Gb, 1.73 Gb and 1.68 Gb, respectively. Divergence time and population history analyses of these species reveal that their speciation and population dynamics are correlated with the different stages of uplifting of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We carried out comparative analyses of these genomes and found that many genetic changes, such as gene loss (e.g. opsin genes), pseudogenes (e.g. crystallin genes), mutations (e.g. melanogenesis-related genes), deletions (e.g. scale-related genes) and down-regulation (e.g. circadian rhythm pathway genes), are possibly associated with the regressive features (such as eye degeneration, albinism, rudimentary scales and lack of circadian rhythms), and that some gene expansion (e.g. taste-related transcription factor gene) may point to the constructive features (such as enhanced taste buds) which evolved in these cave fishes. Conclusion: As the first report on cavefish genomes among distinct species in Sinocyclocheilus, our work provides not only insights into genetic mechanisms of cave adaptation, but also represents a fundamental resource for a better understanding of cavefish biology.},

Here, we present GENESPACE, which addresses these challenges by integrating conserved gene order and orthology to define the expected physical position of all genes across multiple genomes. We demonstrate this utility by dissecting presence–absence, copy-number, and structural variation at three levels of biological organization: spanning 300 million years of vertebrate sex chromosome evolution, across the diversity of the Poaceae (grass) plant family, and among 26 maize cultivars. The methods to build and visualize syntenic orthology in the GENESPACE R package offer a significant addition to existing gene family and synteny programs, especially in polyploid, outbred, and other complex genomes.},

	abstract = {The complex relationship between ontogeny and phylogeny has been the subject of attention and controversy since von Baer's formulations in the 19th century. The classic concept that embryogenesis progresses from clade general features to species-specific characters has often been revisited. It has become accepted that embryos from a clade show maximum morphological similarity at the so-called phylotypic period (i.e., during mid-embryogenesis). According to the hourglass model, body plan conservation would depend on constrained molecular mechanisms operating at this period. More recently, comparative transcriptomic analyses have provided conclusive evidence that such molecular constraints exist. Examining cis-regulatory architecture during the phylotypic period is essential to understand the evolutionary source of body plan stability. Here we compare transcriptomes and key epigenetic marks (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac) from medaka (Oryzias latipes) and zebrafish (Danio rerio), two distantly related teleosts separated by an evolutionary distance of 115-200 Myr. We show that comparison of transcriptome profiles correlates with anatomical similarities and heterochronies observed at the phylotypic stage. Through comparative epigenomics, we uncover a pool of conserved regulatory regions (≈700), which are active during the vertebrate phylotypic period in both species. Moreover, we show that their neighboring genes encode mainly transcription factors with fundamental roles in tissue specification. We postulate that these regulatory regions, active in both teleost genomes, represent key constrained nodes of the gene networks that sustain the vertebrate body plan. © 2014 Tena et al.},

Recent studies have shown that SVs can not only affect gene dosage but also modulate basic mechanisms of gene regulation. SVs can alter the copy number of regulatory elements or modify the 3D genome by disrupting higher-order chromatin organization such as topologically associating domains. As a result of these position effects, SVs can influence the expression of genes distant from the SV breakpoints, thereby causing disease. The impact of SVs on the 3D genome and on gene expression regulation has to be considered when interpreting the pathogenic potential of these variant types.},

The 3D organization of chromatin modulates biological processes such as transcription, DNA replication, cell division and meiosis, which are crucial for cell differentiation and animal development. In this Review, we discuss recent progress in our understanding of the general principles of chromatin folding, its regulation and its functions in mammalian development. Specifically, we discuss the dynamics of 3D chromatin and genome organization during gametogenesis, embryonic development, lineage commitment and stem cell differentiation, and focus on the functions of chromatin architecture in transcription regulation.

	abstract = {Signaling pathways control a large number of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) during animal development, acting as major tools for body plan formation1. Remarkably, in contrast to the large number of transcription factors present in animal genomes, only a few of these pathways operate during development2. Moreover, most of them are largely conserved along metazoan evolution3. How evolution has generated a vast diversity of animal morphologies with such a limited number of tools is still largely unknown. Here we show that gain of interconnectivity between signaling pathways, and the GRNs they control, may have played a critical contribution to the origin of vertebrates. We perturbed the retinoic acid, Wnt, FGF and Nodal signaling pathways during gastrulation in amphioxus and zebrafish and comparatively examined its effects in gene expression and cis-regulatory elements (CREs). We found that multiple developmental genes gain response to these pathways through novel CREs in the vertebrate lineage. Moreover, in contrast to amphioxus, many of these CREs are highly interconnected and respond to multiple pathways in zebrafish. Furthermore, we found that vertebrate-specific cell types are more enriched in highly interconnected genes than those tissues with more ancestral origin. Thus, the increase of CREs in vertebrates integrating inputs from different signaling pathways probably contributed to gene expression complexity and the formation of new cell types and morphological novelties in this lineage.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

We found evidence that dismantling of the duplicated GRB copies occurred early in vertebrate evolution often through the differential retention of the regulatory gene but loss of the bystander gene's exonic sequences. Despite the large evolutionary scale, the presence of duplicated highly conserved non-coding regions provided unambiguous proof for this scenario for multiple ancient GRBs. Remarkably, the dismantling of ancient GRB duplicates has contributed to the creation of large gene deserts associated with regulatory genes in vertebrates, providing a potentially widespread mechanism for the origin of these enigmatic genomic traits.},

Humans and each of these three bird clades exhibit specialized behavioral, neuroanatomical, and brain gene expression convergence related to vocal learning, speech, and song. To understand the evolutionary basis of vocal learning gene specializations and convergence, we searched for and identified accelerated genomic regions (ARs), a marker of positive selection, specific to vocal learning birds. We found avian vocal learner-specific ARs, and they were enriched in noncoding regions near genes with known speech functions or brain gene expression specializations in humans and vocal learning birds, including FOXP2, NEUROD6, ZEB2, and MEF2C, and near genes with major neurodevelopmental functions, including NR2F1, NRP2, and BCL11B. We also found enrichment near the SFARI class S genes associated with syndromic vocal communication forms of autism spectrum disorders. These findings reveal strong candidate noncoding regions near genes for the evolutionary adaptations that distinguish vocal learning species from their close vocal nonlearning relatives and provide further evidence of molecular convergence between birdsong and human spoken language.},

	abstract = {Methods for detecting nucleotide substitution rates that are faster or slower than expected under neutral drift are widely used to identify candidate functional elements in genomic sequences. However, most existing methods consider either reductions (conservation) or increases (acceleration) in rate but not both, or assume that selection acts uniformly across the branches of a phylogeny. Here we examine the more general problem of detecting departures from the neutral rate of substitution in either direction, possibly in a clade-specific manner. We consider four statistical, phylogenetic tests for addressing this problem: a likelihood ratio test, a score test, a test based on exact distributions of numbers of substitutions, and the genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) test. All four tests have been implemented in a freely available program called phyloP. Based on extensive simulation experiments, these tests are remarkably similar in statistical power. With 36 mammalian species, they all appear to be capable of fairly good sensitivity with low false-positive rates in detecting strong selection at individual nucleotides, moderate selection in 3-bp elements, and weaker or clade-specific selection in longer elements. By applying phyloP to mammalian multiple alignments from the ENCODE project, we shed light on patterns of conservation/acceleration in known and predicted functional elements, approximate fractions of sites subject to constraint, and differences in clade-specific selection in the primate and glires clades. We also describe new "Conservation" tracks in the UCSC Genome Browser that display both phyloP and phastCons scores for genome-wide alignments of 44 vertebrate species. © 2010 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

	abstract = {Primates have adapted to numerous environments and lifestyles but very few species are native to high elevations. Here we investigated high-altitude adaptations in the gelada (Theropithecus gelada), a monkey endemic to the Ethiopian Plateau. We examined genome-wide variation in conjunction with measurements of haematological and morphological traits. Our new gelada reference genome is highly intact and assembled at chromosome-length levels. Unexpectedly, we identified a chromosomal polymorphism in geladas that could potentially contribute to reproductive barriers between populations. Compared with baboons at low altitude, we found that high-altitude geladas exhibit significantly expanded chest circumferences, potentially allowing for greater lung surface area for increased oxygen diffusion. We identified gelada-specific amino acid substitutions in the alpha-chain subunit of adult haemoglobin but found that gelada haemoglobin does not exhibit markedly altered oxygenation properties compared with lowland primates. We also found that geladas at high altitude do not exhibit elevated blood haemoglobin concentrations, in contrast to the normal acclimatization response to hypoxia in lowland primates. The absence of altitude-related polycythaemia suggests that geladas are able to sustain adequate tissue-oxygen delivery despite environmental hypoxia. Finally, we identified numerous genes and genomic regions exhibiting accelerated rates of evolution, as well as gene families exhibiting expansions in the gelada lineage, potentially reflecting altitude-related selection. Our findings lend insight into putative mechanisms of high-altitude adaptation while suggesting promising avenues for functional hypoxia research. Analysing a newly assembled genome of the gelada, an endemic Ethiopian monkey that lives in high altitudes, the authors identify a novel karyotype and genomic elements associated with high-altitude adaptation.},

How stage-specific gene expression is orchestrated in vivo remains unclear. Here, using the assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq), we identified ∼4,000 regulatory regions in P. falciparum intraerythrocytic stages. The vast majority of these sites are located within 2 kb upstream of transcribed genes and their chromatin accessibility pattern correlates positively with abundance of the respective mRNA transcript. Importantly, these regions are sufficient to drive stage-specific reporter gene expression and DNA motifs enriched in stage-specific sets of regulatory regions interact with members of the P. falciparum AP2 transcription factor family. Collectively, this study provides initial insights into the in vivo gene regulatory network of P. falciparum intraerythrocytic stages and should serve as a valuable resource for future studies. Proliferation of malaria parasites in human erythrocytes requires the expression of functionally related sets of proteins in a “just-in-time” manner.

	abstract = {Cichlid fishes are famous for large, diverse and replicated adaptive radiations in the Great Lakes of East Africa. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying cichlid phenotypic diversity, we sequenced the genomes and transcriptomes of five lineages of African cichlids: the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), an ancestral lineage with low diversity; and four members of the East African lineage: Neolamprologus brichardi/pulcher (older radiation, Lake Tanganyika), Metriaclima zebra (recent radiation, Lake Malawi), Pundamilia nyererei (very recent radiation, Lake Victoria), and Astatotilapia burtoni (riverine species around Lake Tanganyika). We found an excess of gene duplications in the East African lineage compared to tilapia and other teleosts, an abundance of non-coding element divergence, accelerated coding sequence evolution, expression divergence associated with transposable element insertions, and regulation by novel microRNAs. In addition, we analysed sequence data from sixty individuals representing six closely related species from Lake Victoria, and show genome-wide diversifying selection on coding and regulatory variants, some of which were recruited from ancient polymorphisms. We conclude that a number of molecular mechanisms shaped East African cichlid genomes, and that amassing of standing variation during periods of relaxed purifying selection may have been important in facilitating subsequent evolutionary diversification. Genomes and transcriptomes of five distinct lineages of African cichlids, a textbook example of adaptive radiation, have been sequenced and analysed to reveal that many types of molecular changes contributed to rapid evolution, and that standing variation accumulated during periods of relaxed selection may have primed subsequent diversification. The 2,000 or so species of cichlid fish, to be found in the lakes and rivers of Africa's Rift Valley, provide the classic example of adaptive radiations. This large-scale international collaboration has sequenced and analysed the genomes and transcriptomes of five distinct lineages of African cichlids. The data reveal an excess of gene duplications in comparison to other fish species. There is an abundance of non-coding element divergence; accelerated coding sequence evolution; expression divergence associated with transposable element insertions in orthologous gene pairs; and regulation by novel miRNAs. Sequencing data from sixty individuals from six closely related Lake Victoria species point to rapid cichlid speciation associated with genome-wide diversifying selection on coding and regulatory variants, and imply that ancient periods of relaxed purifying selection enabled the accumulation of standing variation, which may have been important in facilitating diversification.},

	abstract = {Glucocorticoid-induced gene-1 (Gig1) was identified in a yeast one-hybrid screen for factors that interact with the MyoD core enhancer. The Gig1 gene encodes a novel C2H2 zinc finger protein that shares a high degree of sequence similarity with two known DNA binding proteins in humans, Glut4 enhancer factor and papillomavirus binding factor (PBF). The mouse ortholog of PBF was also isolated in the screen. The DNA binding domain of Gig1, which contains TCF-E-tail CR1 and CR2 motifs shown to mediate promoter specificity of TCF-E-tail isoforms, was mapped to a C-terminal domain that is highly conserved in Glut4 enhancer factor and PBF. In mouse embryos, in situ hybridization revealed a restricted pattern of expression of Gig1 that overlaps with MyoD expression. A nuclear-localized lacZ knockin null allele of Gig1 was produced to study Gig1 expression with greater resolution and to assess Gig1 functions. X-gal staining of Gig1nlacZ heterozygous embryos revealed Gig1 expression in myotomal myocytes, skeletal muscle precursors in the limb, and in nascent muscle fibers of the body wall, head and neck, and limbs through E14.5 (latest stage examined). Gig1 was also expressed in a subset of Scleraxis-positive tendon precursors/rudiments of the limbs, but not in the earliest tendon precursors of the somite (syndetome) defined by Scleraxis expression. Additional regions of Gig1 expression included the apical ectodermal ridge, neural tube roof plate and floor plate, apparent motor neurons in the ventral neural tube, otic vesicles, notochord, and several other tissues representing all three germ layers. Gig1 expression was particularly well represented in epithelial tissues and in a number of cells/tissues of neural crest origin. Expression of both the endogenous MyoD gene and a reporter gene driven by MyoD regulatory elements was similar in wild-type and homozygous null Gig1nlacZ embryos, and mutant mice were viable and fertile, indicating that the functions of Gig1 are redundant with other factors. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

	abstract = {Unique human features, such as complex language, are the result of molecular evolutionary changes that modified developmental programs of our brain. The human-specific evolution of the forkhead box P2 (FOXP2) gene-coding region has been linked to the emergence of speech and language in the human kind. However, little is known about how the expression of FOXP2 is regulated and whether its regulatory machinery evolved in a lineage-specific manner in humans. In order to identify FOXP2 regulatory regions containing human-specific changes, we used databases of human-accelerated noncoding sequences or HARs. We found that the topologically associating domain determined using developing human cerebral cortex containing the FOXP2 locus includes two clusters of 12 HARs, placing the locus occupied by FOXP2 among the top regions showing fast acceleration rates in noncoding regions in the human genome. Using in vivo enhancer assays in zebrafish, we found that at least five FOXP2-HARs behave as transcriptional enhancers throughout different developmental stages. In addition, we found that at least two FOXP2-HARs direct the expression of the reporter gene EGFP to foxP2-expressing regions and cells. Moreover, we uncovered two FOXP2-HARs showing reporter expression gain of function in the nervous system when compared with the chimpanzee ortholog sequences. Our results indicate that regulatory sequences in the FOXP2 locus underwent a human-specific evolutionary process suggesting that the transcriptional machinery controlling this gene could have also evolved differentially in the human lineage.},

For example, the seizure subontology now reflects the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) guidelines and these enhancements have already shown clinical validity. We present new efforts to harmonize computational definitions of phenotypic abnormalities across the HPO and multiple phenotype ontologies used for animal models of disease. These efforts will benefit software such as Exomiser by improving the accuracy and scope of cross-species phenotype matching. The computational modeling strategy used by the HPO to define disease entities and phenotypic features and distinguish between them is explained in detail.We also report on recent efforts to translate the HPO into indigenous languages.

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1510802112},
	abstract = {Despite recent advances in the understanding of morphological evolution, the genetic underpinnings of behavioral and physiological evolution remain largely unknown. Here, we study the metabolic changes that evolved in independently derived populations of the Mexican cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus. A hallmark of cave environments is scarcity of food. Cavefish populations rely almost entirely on sporadic food input from outside of the caves. To survive under these conditions, cavefish have evolved a range of adaptations, including starvation resistance and binge eating when food becomes available. The use of these adaptive strategies differs among independently derived cave populations. Although all cavefish populations tested lose weight more slowly than their surface conspecifics during restricted rations, only a subset of cavefish populations consume more food than their surface counterparts. A candidate gene-based screen led to the identification of coding mutations in conserved residues of the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene, contributing to the insatiable appetite found in some populations of cavefish. Intriguingly, one of the mutated residues has been shown to be linked to obesity in humans. We demonstrate that the allele results in both reduced maximal response and reduced basal activity of the receptor in vitro. We further validate in vivo that the mutated allele contributes to elevated appetite, growth, and starvation resistance. The allele appears to be fixed in cave populations in which the overeating phenotype is present. The presence of the same allele in multiple caves appears to be due to selection from standing genetic variation present in surface populations.},

	abstract = {Cis-regulatory changes are arguably the primary evolutionary source of animal morphological diversity. With the recent explosion of genome-wide comparisons of the cis-regulatory content in different animal species is now possible to infer general principles underlying enhancer evolution. However, these studies have also revealed numerous discrepancies and paradoxes, suggesting that the mechanistic causes and modes of cis-regulatory evolution are still not well understood and are probably much more complex than generally appreciated. Here, we argue that the mutational mechanisms and genomic regions generating new regulatory activities must comply with the constraints imposed by the molecular properties of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and the organizational features of long-range chromatin interactions. Accordingly, we propose a new integrative evolutionary framework for cis-regulatory evolution based on two major premises for the origin of novel enhancer activity: (i) an accessible chromatin environment and (ii) compatibility with the 3D structure and interactions of pre-existing CREs. Mechanisms and DNA sequences not fulfilling these premises, will be less likely to have a measurable impact on gene expression and as such, will have a minor contribution to the evolution of gene regulation. Finally, we discuss current comparative cis-regulatory data under the light of this new evolutionary model, and propose that the two most prominent mechanisms for the evolution of cis-regulatory changes are the overprinting of ancestral CREs and the exaptation of transposable elements.},

	abstract = {Proper cell fate determination is largely orchestrated by complex gene regulatory networks centered around transcription factors. However, experimental elucidation of key transcription factors that drive cellular identity is often intractable. Here, we present ANANSE (ANalysis Algorithm for Networks Specified by Enhancers), a network-based method that exploits enhancer-encoded regulatory information to identify the key transcription factors in cell fate determination. As cell type-specific transcription factors predominantly bind to enhancers, we use regulatory networks based on enhancer properties to prioritize transcription factors. First, we predict genome-wide binding profiles of transcription factors in various cell types using enhancer activity and transcription factor binding motifs. Subsequently, applying these inferred binding profiles, we construct cell type-specific gene regulatory networks, and then predict key transcription factors controlling cell fate conversions using differential gene networks between cell types. Compared to other existing methods, ANANSE correctly predicts the highest number of transcription factors experimentally demonstrated to be sufficient for trans-differentiation. Finally, we apply ANANSE to define an atlas of key transcription factors in 18 normal human tissues. In conclusion, we present a ready-to-implement computational tool for efficient prediction of transcription factors in cell fate determination and to study transcription factor-mediated regulatory mechanisms.

	abstract = {Phylogenomic studies using genome-wide datasets are quickly becoming the state of the art for systematics and comparative studies, but in many cases, they result in strongly supported incongruent results. The extent to which this conflict is real depends on different sources of error potentially affecting big datasets (assembly, stochastic, and systematic error). Here, we apply a recently developed methodology (GGI or gene genealogy interrogation) and data curation to new and published datasets with more than 1000 exons, 500 ultraconserved element (UCE) loci, and transcriptomic sequences that support incongruent hypotheses. The contentious non-monophyly of the order Characiformes proposed by two studies is shown to be a spurious outcome induced by sample contamination in the transcriptomic dataset and an ambiguous result due to poor taxonomic sampling in the UCE dataset. By exploring the effects of number of taxa and loci used for analysis, we show that the power of GGI to discriminate among competing hypotheses is diminished by limited taxonomic sampling, but not equally sensitive to gene sampling. Taken together, our results reinforce the notion that merely increasing the number of genetic loci for a few representative taxa is not a robust strategy to advance phylogenetic knowledge of recalcitrant groups. We leverage the expanded exon capture dataset generated here for Characiformes (206 species in 23 out of 24 families) to produce a comprehensive phylogeny and a revised classification of the order.},

	abstract = {The intestinal epithelium serves critical physiologic functions that are shared among all vertebrates. However, it is unknown how the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying these functions have changed over the course of vertebrate evolution. We generated genome-wide mRNA and accessible chromatin data from adult intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in zebrafish, stickleback, mouse, and human species to determine if conserved IEC functions are achieved through common transcriptional regulation. We found evidence for substantial common regulation and conservation of gene expression regionally along the length of the intestine from fish to mammals and identified a core set of genes comprising a vertebrate IEC signature. We also identified transcriptional start sites and other putative regulatory regions that are differentially accessible in IECs in all 4 species. Although these sites rarely showed sequence conservation from fish to mammals, surprisingly, they drove highly conserved IEC expression in a zebrafish reporter assay. Common putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) found at these sites in multiple species indicate that sequence conservation alone is insufficient to identify much of the functionally conserved IEC regulatory information. Among the rare, highly sequence-conserved, IEC-specific regulatory regions, we discovered an ancient enhancer upstream from her6/HES1 that is active in a distinct population of Notch-positive cells in the intestinal epithelium. Together, these results show how combining accessible chromatin and mRNA datasets with TFBS prediction and in vivo reporter assays can reveal tissue-specific regulatory information conserved across 420 million years of vertebrate evolution. We define an IEC transcriptional regulatory network that is shared between fish and mammals and establish an experimental platform for studying how evolutionarily distilled regulatory information commonly controls IEC development and physiology.},

However, such studies have so far been hampered because of a highly fragmented genome assembly.

The assembly comprises 26 autosomes with sizes ranging from 12.4 to 33.1 Mb and a total size, in chromosomes, of 726 Mb, which has been corroborated by a high-resolution linkage map. A comparison between the herring genome assembly with other high-quality assemblies from bony fishes revealed few inter-chromosomal but frequent intra-chromosomal rearrangements. The improved assembly facilitates analysis of previously intractable large-scale structural variation, allowing, for example, the detection of a 7.8-Mb inversion on Chromosome 12 underlying ecological adaptation. This supergene shows strong genetic differentiation between populations. The chromosome-based assembly also markedly improves the interpretation of previously detected signals of selection, allowing us to reveal hundreds of independent loci associated with ecological adaptation.},

	abstract = {Background: Previous molecular studies on the phylogeny and classification of clupeocephalan fishes revealed numerous new taxonomic entities. For re-analysing these taxa, we perform target gene capturing and subsequent next generation sequencing of putative ortholog exons of major clupeocephalan lineages. Sequence information for the RNA bait design was derived from publicly available genomes of bony fishes. Newly acquired sequence data comprising {\textgreater} 800 exon sequences was subsequently used for phylogenetic reconstructions. Results: Our results support monophyletic Otomorpha comprising Alepocephaliformes. Within Ostariophysi, Gonorynchiformes are sister to a clade comprising Cypriniformes, Characiformes, Siluriformes and Gymnotiformes, where the interrelationships of Characiformes, Siluriformes and Gymnotiformes remain enigmatic. Euteleosts comprise four major clades: Lepidogalaxiiformes, Protacanthopterygii, Stomiatii, and Galaxiiformes plus Neoteleostei. The monotypic Lepidogalaxiiformes form the sister-group to all remaining euteleosts. Protacanthopterygii, comprising Argentini-, Esoci- and Salmoniformes, is sister to Stomiatii (Osmeriformes and Stomiatiformes) and Galaxiiformes plus Neoteleostei. Conclusions: Several proposed monophyla defined by morphological apomorphies within the Clupeocephalan phylogeny are confirmed by the phylogenetic estimates presented herein. However, other morphologically described groups cannot be reconciled with molecular phylogenies. Thus, numerous morphological apomoprhies of supposed monophyla are called into question. The interpretation of suggested morphological synapomorphies of otomorph fishes is strongly affected by the inclusion of deep-sea inhabiting, and to that effect morphologically adapted Alepocephaliformes. Our revision of these potential synapomorphies, in the context that Alepocephaliformes are otomorph fishes, reveals that only a single character of the total nine characters proposed as synapomorphic for the group is clearly valid for all otomorphs. Three further characters remain possible apomorphies since their status remains unclear in the deep-sea adapted Alepocephaliformes showing developmental lag and lacking a swim bladder. Further, our analysis places Galaxiiformes as sister group to neoteleosts, which contradicts some previous molecular phylogenetic studies. This needs further investigation from a morphological perspective, as suggested synapomophies for several euteleostean lineages are challenged or still lacking. For the verification of results presented herein, a denser phylogenomic-level taxon sampling should be applied.},

	abstract = {Background: Fish classifications, as those of most other taxonomic groups, are being transformed drastically as new molecular phylogenies provide support for natural groups that were unanticipated by previous studies. A brief review of the main criteria used by ichthyologists to define their classifications during the last 50 years, however, reveals slow progress towards using an explicit phylogenetic framework. Instead, the trend has been to rely, in varying degrees, on deep-rooted anatomical concepts and authority, often mixing taxa with explicit phylogenetic support with arbitrary groupings. Two leading sources in ichthyology frequently used for fish classifications (JS Nelson's volumes of Fishes of the World and W. Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes) fail to adopt a global phylogenetic framework despite much recent progress made towards the resolution of the fish Tree of Life. The first explicit phylogenetic classification of bony fishes was published in 2013, based on a comprehensive molecular phylogeny (www.deepfin.org). We here update the first version of that classification by incorporating the most recent phylogenetic results. Results: The updated classification presented here is based on phylogenies inferred using molecular and genomic data for nearly 2000 fishes. A total of 72 orders (and 79 suborders) are recognized in this version, compared with 66 orders in version 1. The phylogeny resolves placement of 410 families, or {\textasciitilde}80\% of the total of 514 families of bony fishes currently recognized. The ordinal status of 30 percomorph families included in this study, however, remains uncertain (incertae sedis in the series Carangaria, Ovalentaria, or Eupercaria). Comments to support taxonomic decisions and comparisons with conflicting taxonomic groups proposed by others are presented. We also highlight cases were morphological support exist for the groups being classified. Conclusions: This version of the phylogenetic classification of bony fishes is substantially improved, providing resolution for more taxa than previous versions, based on more densely sampled phylogenetic trees. The classification presented in this study represents, unlike any other, the most up-to-date hypothesis of the Tree of Life of fishes.},

We reconstruct their diversification using a new fossil-calibrated molecular phylogeny, dietary information, and geometric morphometrics. Though body shape diversified early in a manner consistent with an ancient continental adaptive radiation, trophic shifts did not always coincide with shape changes. With the notable exception of piscivores, lineages that converged in diet did not converge closely in body shape. Shifts in habitat or other variables likely influenced body shape evolution in addition to changes in diet, and the clade's history departs from many classic adaptive radiations in lakes or on islands, in which trophic convergence drives morphological convergence. The contrast between the Neotropical radiation's exhaustive exploration of morphospace and the more restrained diversification in Africa suggests a major role for contingency in characiform evolution, with the presence of cypriniform competitors in the Old World, but not the New, providing one possible explanation. Our results depict the clearest ecomorphological reconstruction to date for Characiformes and set the stage for studies further elucidating the processes underlying its diversification.},

Our evaluation of genes under positive selection suggests candidates for adaptations of piranhas’ feeding behavior in neural functions, behavior, and regulation of energy metabolism. In the fasted brain, we find genes differentially expressed that are involved in lipid metabolism and appetite regulation as well as genes that may control the aggression/boldness behavior of hungry piranhas. Our first analysis of the piranha genome offers new insight and resources for the study of piranha biology and for feeding motivation and starvation in other organisms.},

	abstract = {Regulatory landscapes have been defined in vertebrates as large DNA segments containing diverse enhancer sequences that produce coherent gene transcription. These genomic platforms integrate multiple cellular signals and hence can trigger pleiotropic expression of developmental genes. Identifying and evaluating how these chromatin regions operate may be difficult as the underlying regulatory mechanisms can be as unique as the genes they control. In this brief article and accompanying poster, we discuss some of the ways in which regulatory landscapes operate, illustrating these mechanisms using genes important for vertebrate development as examples. We also highlight some of the techniques available to researchers for analysing regulatory landscapes.},

	abstract = {Impaired insulin secretion from pancreatic islets is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Altered chromatin structure may contribute to the disease. We therefore studied the impact of T2D on open chromatin in human pancreatic islets. We used assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) to profile open chromatin in islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We identified 57,105 and 53,284 ATAC-seq peaks representing open chromatin regions in islets of non-diabetic and diabetic donors, respectively. The majority of ATAC-seq peaks mapped near transcription start sites. Additionally, peaks were enriched in enhancer regions and in regions where islet-specific transcription factors (TFs), e.g. FOXA2, MAFB, NKX2.2, NKX6.1 and PDX1, bind. Islet ATAC-seq peaks overlap with 13 SNPs associated with T2D (e.g. rs7903146, rs2237897, rs757209, rs11708067 and rs878521 near TCF7L2, KCNQ1, HNF1B, ADCY5 and GCK, respectively) and with additional 67 SNPs in LD with known T2D SNPs (e.g. SNPs annotated to GIPR, KCNJ11, GLIS3, IGF2BP2, FTO and PPARG). There was enrichment of open chromatin regions near highly expressed genes in human islets. Moreover, 1,078 open chromatin peaks, annotated to 898 genes, differed in prevalence between diabetic and non-diabetic islet donors. Some of these peaks are annotated to candidate genes for T2D and islet dysfunction (e.g. HHEX, HMGA2, GLIS3, MTNR1B and PARK2) and some overlap with SNPs associated with T2D (e.g. rs3821943 near WFS1 and rs508419 near ANK1). Enhancer regions and motifs specific to key TFs including BACH2, FOXO1, FOXA2, NEUROD1, MAFA and PDX1 were enriched in differential islet ATAC-seq peaks of T2D versus non-diabetic donors. Our study provides new understanding into how T2D alters the chromatin landscape, and thereby accessibility for TFs and gene expression, in human pancreatic islets.},

	abstract = {When it comes to vertebrate evolutionary history, our understanding of lobe-finned fishes—the branch of the vertebrate tree leading to coelacanths plus the tetrapods (amphibians, turtles, birds, crocodiles, lizards, snakes, and mammals)—far outstrips our knowledge of ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii). Actinopterygians exhibit extraordinary species richness ({\textgreater}33,000 described species) and have evolved a staggering diversity in morphology and ecology over their 400+ million y history. Ray-finned fishes include some of the smallest vertebrates [the adult cyprinid Paedocypris progenetica measure just under 8 mm (1)], some of the largest (adult ocean sunfish weigh more than 2,000 kg), some of the longest (oarfishes may reach a length of more than 13 m), some of the longest lived [rougheye rockfishes, Sebastes aleutianus , may live for more than 200 y (2)], and some of the shortest lived [the coral reef pygmy goby, Eviota sigillata , has a maximum lifespan of 59 d (3)]. In marine waters, ray-finned fishes include the tremendously diverse and ecologically rich coral reef fish families, such as wrasses, angelfishes, butterfly fishes, and damselfishes, and they comprise most important commercial and recreational fishing stocks. Within freshwaters, ray-finned fishes have produced several ecologically dominant radiations, including cyprinids, characiforms, catfishes, and cichlids. Efforts to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of this group have proven extremely challenging (4, 5), especially within acanthomorphs (6, 7), a hyperdiverse subclade comprising almost two-thirds of all ray-finned fish species.

One of the major impediments to understanding higher-level ray-finned fish relationships has been the lack of obvious morphological characters that unite major lineages (reviewed in ref. 8). Within the last 5 y, large-scale multilocus sequencing efforts have produced novel insights in the ray-finned fish backbone phylogeny, including unexpectedly close relationships among morphologically disparate lineages …

	doi = {10.1101/gr.133546.111},
	abstract = {Enhancers are essential gene regulatory elements whose alteration can lead to morphological differences between species, developmental abnormalities, and human disease. Current strategies to identify enhancers focus primarily on noncoding sequences and tend to exclude protein coding sequences. Here, we analyzed 25 available ChIP-seq data sets that identify enhancers in an unbiased manner (H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and EP300) for peaks that overlap exons. We find that, on average, 7\% of all ChIP-seq peaks overlap coding exons (after excluding for peaks that overlap with first exons). By using mouse and zebrafish enhancer assays, we demonstrate that several of these exonic enhancer (eExons) candidates can function as enhancers of their neighboring genes and that the exonic sequence is necessary for enhancer activity. Using ChIP, 3C, and DNA FISH, we further show that one of these exonic limb enhancers, Dync1i1 exon 15, has active enhancer marks and physically interacts with Dlx5/6 promoter regions 900 kb away. In addition, its removal by chromosomal abnormalities in humans could cause split hand and foot malformation 1 (SHFM1), a disorder associated with DLX5/6. These results demonstrate that DNA sequences can have a dual function, operating as coding exons in one tissue and enhancers of nearby gene(s) in another tissue, suggesting that phenotypes resulting from coding mutations could be caused not only by protein alteration but also by disrupting the regulation of another gene.},

	abstract = {Hi-C is a genome-wide chromosome conformation capture technology that detects interactions between pairs of genomic regions, and exploits higher order chromatin structures. Conceptually Hi-C data counts interaction frequencies between every position in the genome and every other position. Biologically functional interactions are expected to occur more frequently than random (background) interactions. To identify biologically relevant interactions, several background models that take biases such as distance, GC content and mappability into account have been proposed. Here we introduce MaxHiC, a background correction tool that deals with these complex biases and robustly identifies statistically significant interactions in both Hi-C and capture Hi-C experiments. MaxHiC uses a negative binomial distribution model and a maximum likelihood technique to correct biases in both Hi-C and capture Hi-C libraries. We systematically benchmark MaxHiC against major Hi-C background correction tools and demonstrate using published Hi-C and capture Hi-C datasets that 1) Interacting regions identified by MaxHiC have significantly greater levels of overlap with known regulatory features (e.g. active chromatin histone marks, CTCF binding sites, DNase sensitivity) and also disease-associated genome-wide association SNPs than those identified by currently existing models, and 2) the pairs of interacting regions are more likely to be linked by eQTL pairs and more likely to identify known enhancer-promoter pairs than any of the existing methods. We also demonstrate that interactions between different genomic region types have distinct distance distribution only revealed by MaxHiC. MaxHiC is publicly available as a python package for the analysis of Hi-C and capture Hi-C data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Species-specific cell types were enriched for the expression of species-specific genes, and characterized by the neo-functionalization of members of recently expanded or contracted gene families. Within species comparisons revealed differences in immune repertoires and transcriptional changes in neuropeptidergic cell types associated with genomic differences between surface-and cave-morphs.

	abstract = {Hadal environments (depths below 6,000 m) are characterized by extremely high hydrostatic pressures, low temperatures, a scarce food supply, and little light. The evolutionary adaptations that allow vertebrates to survive in this extreme environment are poorly understood. Here, we constructed a high-quality reference genome for Yap hadal snailfish (YHS), which was captured at a depth of {\textasciitilde}7,000 m in the Yap Trench. The final YHS genome assembly was 731.75 Mb, with a contig N50 of 0.75 Mb and a scaffold N50 of 1.26 Mb. We predicted 24,329 protein-coding genes in the YHS genome, and 24,265 of these genes were successfully functionally annotated. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that YHS diverged from a Mariana Trench snailfish approximately 0.92 million years ago. Many genes associated with DNA repair show evidence of positive selection and have expanded copy numbers in the YHS genome, possibly helping to maintain the integrity of DNA under increased hydrostatic pressure. The levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a potent protein stabilizer, are much higher in the muscles of YHS than in those of shallow-water fish. This difference is perhaps due to the five copies of the TMAO-generating enzyme flavin-containing monooxygenase-3 gene ( fmo3 ) in the YHS genome and the abundance of trimethylamine (TMA)-generating bacteria in the YHS gut. Thus, the high TMAO content might help YHS adapt to high hydrostatic pressure by improving protein stability. Additionally, the evolutionary features of the YHS genes encoding sensory-related proteins are consistent with the scarce food supply and darkness in the hadal environments. These results clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptation of hadal organisms to the deep-sea environment and provide valuable genomic resources for in-depth investigations of hadal biology.},

	abstract = {Background: Freshwater harbors approximately 12,000 fish species accounting for 43\% of the diversity of all modern fish. A single ancestral lineage evolved into about two-thirds of this enormous biodiversity ( 7900 spp.) and is currently distributed throughout the world's continents except Antarctica. Despite such remarkable species diversity and ubiquity, the evolutionary history of this major freshwater fish clade, Otophysi, remains largely unexplored. To gain insight into the history of otophysan diversification, we constructed a timetree based on whole mitogenome sequences across 110 species representing 55 of the 64 families. Results: Partitioned maximum likelihood analysis based on unambiguously aligned sequences (9923 bp) confidently recovered the monophyly of Otophysi and the two constituent subgroups (Cypriniformes and Characiphysi). The latter clade comprised three orders (Gymnotiformes, Characiformes, Siluriformes), and Gymnotiformes was sister to the latter two groups. One of the two suborders in Characiformes (Characoidei) was more closely related to Siluriformes than to its own suborder (Citharinoidei), rendering the characiforms paraphyletic. Although this novel relationship did not receive strong statistical support, it was supported by analyzing independent nuclear markers. A relaxed molecular clock Bayesian analysis of the divergence times and reconstruction of ancestral habitats on the timetree suggest a Pangaean origin and Mesozoic radiation of otophysans. Conclusions: The present timetree demonstrates that survival of the ancestral lineages through the two consecutive mass extinctions on Pangaea, and subsequent radiations during the Jurassic through early Cretaceous shaped the modern familial diversity of otophysans. This evolutionary scenario is consistent with recent arguments based on biogeographic inferences and molecular divergence time estimates. No fossil otophysan, however, has been recorded before the Albian, the early Cretaceous 100-112 Ma, creating an over 100 million year time span without fossil evidence. This formidable ghost range partially reflects a genuine difference between the estimated ages of stem group origin (molecular divergence time) and crown group morphological diversification (fossil divergence time); the ghost range, however, would be filled with discoveries of older fossils that can be used as more reasonable time constraints as well as with developments of more realistic models that capture the rates of molecular sequences accurately. © 2011 Nakatani et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Micro-C robustly captures known features of chromosome folding including compartment organization, topologically associating domains, and interactions between CTCF binding sites. In addition, Micro-C provides a detailed map of nucleosome positions and localizes contact domain boundaries with nucleosomal precision. Compared to Hi-C, Micro-C exhibits an order of magnitude greater dynamic range, allowing the identification of ∼20,000 additional loops in each cell type. Many newly identified peaks are localized along extrusion stripes and form transitive grids, consistent with their anchors being pause sites impeding cohesin-dependent loop extrusion. Our analyses comprise the highest-resolution maps of chromosome folding in human cells to date, providing a valuable resource for studies of chromosome organization. Krietenstein et al. extend analyses of chromosome folding to nucleosome resolution in human cells.

A related species in the same order (Siluriformes), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), does not possess an ABO and thus cannot breathe in the air. Tra and channel catfish serve as great comparative models for investigating possible genetic underpinnings of aquatic to land transitions, as well as for understanding genes that are crucial for the development of the swim bladder and the function of air-breathing in tra catfish. In this study, hypoxia challenge and microtomy experiments collectively revealed critical time points for the development of the air-breathing function and swim bladder in tra catfish. Seven developmental stages in tra catfish were selected for RNA-seq analysis based on their transition to a stage that could live at 0 ppm oxygen. More than 587 million sequencing clean reads were generated, and a total of 21,448 unique genes were detected. A comparative genomic analysis between channel catfish and tra catfish revealed 76 genes that were present in tra catfish, but absent from channel catfish. In order to further narrow down the list of these candidate genes, gene expression analysis was performed for these tra catfish-specific genes. Fourteen genes were inferred to be important for air-breathing. Of these, HRG, GRP, and CX3CL1 were identified to be the most likely genes related to air-breathing ability in tra catfish. This study provides a foundational data resource for functional genomic studies in air-breathing function in tra catfish and sheds light on the adaptation of aquatic organisms to the terrestrial environment.},

	abstract = {Similar forms often evolve repeatedly in nature, raising long-standing questions about the underlying mechanisms. Here, we use repeated evolution in stickleback to identify a large set of genomic loci that change recurrently during colonization of freshwater habitats by marine fish. The same loci used repeatedly in extant populations also show rapid allele frequency changes when new freshwater populations are experimentally established from marine ancestors. Marked genotypic and phenotypic changes arise within 5 years, facilitated by standing genetic variation and linkage between adaptive regions. Both the speed and location of changes can be predicted using empirical observations of recurrence in natural populations or fundamental genomic features like allelic age, recombination rates, density of divergent loci, and overlap with mapped traits. A composite model trained on these stickleback features can also predict the location of key evolutionary loci in Darwin's finches, suggesting that similar features are important for evolution across diverse taxa.},

	abstract = {Genetic modifications in noncoding regulatory regions are likely critical to human evolution. Human-accelerated noncoding elements are highly conserved noncoding regions among vertebrates but have large differences across humans, which implies human-specific regulatory potential. In this study, we found that human-accelerated noncoding elements were frequently coupled with DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs), together with monomethylated and trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4, which are active regul atory markers. Thi s coupl i ng was parti cul arl y pronounced in fetal brains relative to adult brains, non-brain fetal tissues, and embryonic stem cells. However, fetal brain DHSs were also specifically enriched in deeply conserved sequences, implying coexistence of universal maintenance and human-specific fitness in human brain development. We assessed whether this coexisting pattern was a general one by quantitatively measuring evolutionary rates of DHSs. As a result, fetal brain DHSs showed a mixed but distinct signature of regional conservation and outlier point acceleration as compared to other DHSs. This finding suggests that brain developmental sequences are selectively constrained in general, whereas specific nucleotides are under positive selection or constraint relaxation simultaneously. Hence, we hypothesize that human-or primate-specific changes to universally conserved regulatory codes of brain development may drive the accelerated, and most likely adaptive, evolution of the regulatory network of the human brain.},

	abstract = {ATAC-seq is widely used to measure chromatin accessibility and identify open chromatin regions (OCRs). OCRs usually indicate active regulatory elements in the genome and are directly associated with the gene regulatory network. The identification of differential accessibility regions (DARs) between different biological conditions is critical in determining the differential activity of regulatory elements. Differential analysis of ATAC-seq shares many similarities with differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data. However, the distribution of ATAC-seq signal intensity is different from that of RNA-seq data, and higher sensitivity is required for DARs identification. Many different tools can be used to perform differential analysis of ATAC-seq data, but a comprehensive comparison and benchmarking of these methods is still lacking. Here, we used simulated datasets to systematically measure the sensitivity and specificity of six different methods. We further discussed the statistical and signal density cut-offs in the differential analysis of ATAC-seq by applying them to real data. Batch effects are very common in high-throughput sequencing experiments. We illustrated that batch-effect correction can dramatically improve sensitivity in the differential analysis of ATAC-seq data. Finally, we developed a user-friendly package, BeCorrect, to perform batch effect correction and visualization of corrected ATAC-seq signals in a genome browser.},

	abstract = {The evolution of gene regulation is considered one of the main drivers causing the astonishing morphological diversity in the animal kingdom. Gene regulation in animals heavily depends upon cis-regulatory elements, discrete pieces of DNA that interact with target promoters to regulate gene expression. In the last years, Chromosome Conformation Capture experiments (4C-seq, 5C, and HiC) in several organisms have shown that the genomes of many bilaterian animals are organized in the 3D chromatin space in compartments called topologically associated domains (TADs). The appearance of the architectural protein CTCF in the bilaterian ancestor likely facilitated the origin of this chromatin 3D organization. TADs play a critical role favoring the contact of cis-regulatory elements with their proper target promoters (that often lay within the same TAD) and preventing undesired regulatory interactions with promoters located in neighboring TADs. We propose that TAD may have had a major influence in the history of the evolution of gene regulation. They have contributed to the increment of regulatory complexity in bilaterians by allowing newly evolved cis-regulatory elements to find target promoters in a range of hundreds of kilobases. In addition, they have conditioned the mechanisms of evolution of gene regulation. These mechanisms include the appearance, removal, or relocation of TAD borders. Such architectural changes have been able to wire or unwire promoters with different sets of cis-regulatory elements in a single mutational event. We discuss the contribution of these architectural changes to the generation of critical genomic 3D structures required for new regulatory mechanisms associated to morphological novelties.

Furthermore, the higher-level organization of mouse TF-to-TF connections into cellular network architectures is nearly identical with human.

While numerous studies focus on the effects of these features on broader gene regulation, less work has been done on the mechanisms of gene-specific transcriptional control. In this study, we have focussed on the latter by integrating gene expression data for the in vitro differentiation of murine ES cells to macrophages and cardiomyocytes, with dynamic data on chromatin structure, epigenetics and transcription factor binding. Combining a novel strategy to identify communities of related control elements with a penalized regression approach, we developed individual models to identify the potential control elements predictive of the expression of each gene. Our models were compared to an existing method and evaluated using the existing literature and new experimental data from embryonic stem cell differentiation reporter assays.

Investigating the loss of sight in cave dwellers presents an opportunity to understand the operation of fundamental evolutionary processes, including drift, selection, mutation, and migration. Results: Here we model the evolution of blindness in caves. This model captures the interaction of three forces: (1) selection favoring alleles causing blindness, (2) immigration of sightedness alleles from a surface population, and (3) mutations creating blindness alleles. We investigated the dynamics of this model and determined selection-strength thresholds that result in blindness evolving in caves despite immigration of sightedness alleles from the surface. We estimate that the selection coefficient for blindness would need to be at least 0.005 (and maybe as high as 0.5) for blindness to evolve in the model cave-organism, Astyanax mexicanus. Conclusions: Our results indicate that strong selection is required for the evolution of blindness in cave-dwelling organisms, which is consistent with recent work suggesting a high metabolic cost of eye development.},

Fish belong to a unique group of vertebrates, since their karyotypes and genome sizes are more diverse and complex, with probably higher diversity and evolution specificity of TE. To investigate the characteristics of fish TEs, we compared the mobilomes of 39 species, and observed significant variation of TE content in fish (from 5\% in pufferfish to 56\% in zebrafish), along with a positive correlation between fish genome size and TE content. In different classification hierarchies, retrotransposons (class), long terminal repeat (order), as well as Helitron, Maverick, Kolobok, CMC, DIRS, P, I, L1, L2, and 5S (superfamily) were all positively correlated with fish genome size. Consistent with previous studies, our data suggested fish genomes to not always be dominated by DNA transposons; long interspersed nuclear elements are also prominent in many species. This study suggests CR1 distribution in fish genomes to be obviously regular, and provides new clues concerning important events in vertebrate evolution. Altogether, our results highlight the importance of TEs in the structure and evolution of fish genomes and suggest fish species diversity to parallel transposon content diversification.},

	abstract = {In many developing tissues the patterns of gene expression that assign cell fate are organised by secreted signals functioning in a graded manner over multiple cell diameters. Cis Regulatory Elements (CREs) interpret these graded inputs to control gene expression. How this is accomplished remains poorly understood. In the neural tube, a gradient of the morphogen Sonic hedgehog allocates neural progenitor identity. Here, we uncover two distinct ways in which CREs translate graded Shh signaling into differential gene expression. In the majority of ventral neural progenitors a common set of CREs are used to control gene activity. These CREs integrate cell type specific inputs to control gene expression. By contrast, the most ventral progenitors use a unique set of CREs. These are established by the pioneer factor FOXA2, paralleling the role of FOXA2 in endoderm. Moreover, FOXA2 binds a subset of the same sites in neural and endoderm cells. Together the data identify distinct cis regulatory strategies for the interpretation of morphogen signaling and raise the possibility of an evolutionarily conserved role for FOXA2-mediated regulatory strategy across tissues.

	abstract = {Understanding the molecular basis of repeatedly evolved phenotypes can yield key insights into the evolutionary process. Quantifying gene flow between populations is especially important in interpreting mechanisms of repeated phenotypic evolution, and genomic analyses have revealed that admixture occurs more frequently between diverging lineages than previously thought. In this study, we resequenced 47 whole genomes of the Mexican tetra from three cave populations, two surface populations and outgroup samples. We confirmed that cave populations are polyphyletic and two Astyanax mexicanus lineages are present in our data set. The two lineages likely diverged much more recently than previous mitochondrial estimates of 5–7 mya. Divergence of cave populations from their phylogenetically closest surface population likely occurred between {\textasciitilde}161 and 191 k generations ago. The favoured demographic model for most population pairs accounts for divergence with secondary contact and heterogeneous gene flow across the genome, and we rigorously identified gene flow among all lineages sampled. Therefore, the evolution of cave-related traits occurred more rapidly than previously thought, and trogolomorphic traits are maintained despite gene flow with surface populations. The recency of these estimated divergence events suggests that selection may drive the evolution of cave-derived traits, as opposed to disuse and drift. Finally, we show that a key trogolomorphic phenotype QTL is enriched for genomic regions with low divergence between caves, suggesting that regions important for cave phenotypes may be transferred between caves via gene flow. Our study shows that gene flow must be considered in studies of independent, repeated trait evolution.},

These human accelerated regions (HARs) are enriched nearby regulatory genes, and several HARs function as developmental enhancers. To investigate if this evolutionary signature is unique to humans, we quantified evidence of accelerated substitutions in conserved genomic elements across multiple lineages and applied this approach simultaneously to the genomes of five apes: human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon.We find roughly similar numbers and genomic distributions of lineage-specific accelerated regions (linARs) in all five apes. In particular, apes share an enrichment of linARs in regulatory DNA nearby genes involved in development, especially transcription factors and other regulators. Many developmental loci harbor clusters of nonoverlapping linARs from multiple apes, suggesting that accelerated evolution in each species affected distinct regulatory elements that control a shared set of developmental pathways. Our statistical tests distinguish between GC-biased and unbiased accelerated substitution rates, allowing us to quantify the roles of different evolutionary forces in creating linARs. We find evidence of GC-biased gene conversion in each ape, but unbiased acceleration consistent with positive selection or loss of constraint is more common in all five lineages. It therefore appears that similar evolutionary processes created independent accelerated regions in the genomes of different apes, and that these lineage-specific changes to conserved noncoding sequences may have differentially altered expression of a core set of developmental genes across ape evolution.},

	abstract = {Studying how different genotypes respond to environmental variation is essential to understand the genetic basis of adaptation. The Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, has cave and surface-dwelling morphotypes that have adapted to entirely different environments in the wild, and are now successfully maintained in lab conditions. While this has enabled the identification of genetic adaptations underlying a variety of physiological processes, few studies have directly compared morphotypes between lab-reared and natural populations. Such comparative approaches could help dissect the varying effects of environment and morphotype, and determine the extent to which phenomena observed in the lab are generalizable to conditions in the field. To this end, we take a transcriptomic approach to compare the Pachón cavefish and their surface fish counterparts in their natural habitats and the lab environment. We identify key changes in expression of genes implicated in metabolism and physiology between groups of fish, suggesting that morphotype (surface or cave) and environment (natural or lab) both alter gene expression. We find gene expression differences between cave and surface fish in their natural habitats are much larger than differences in expression between morphotypes in the lab environment. However, lab-raised cave and surface fish still exhibit numerous gene expression changes, supporting genetically encoded changes in livers of this species. From this, we conclude that a controlled laboratory environment may serve as an ideal setting to study the genetic underpinnings of metabolic and physiological differences between the cavefish and surface fish.},

	abstract = {Extreme environments test the limits of life; yet, some organisms thrive in harsh conditions. Extremophile lineages inspire questions about how organisms can tolerate physiochemical stressors and whether the repeated colonization of extreme environments is facilitated by predictable and repeatable evolutionary innovations. We identified the mechanistic basis underlying convergent evolution of tolerance to hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S)—a toxicant that impairs mitochondrial function—across evolutionarily independent lineages of a fish ( Poecilia mexicana , Poeciliidae) from H 2 S-rich springs. Using comparative biochemical and physiological analyses, we found that mitochondrial function is maintained in the presence of H 2 S in sulfide spring P. mexicana but not ancestral lineages from nonsulfidic habitats due to convergent adaptations in the primary toxicity target and a major detoxification enzyme. Genome-wide local ancestry analyses indicated that convergent evolution of increased H 2 S tolerance in different populations is likely caused by a combination of selection on standing genetic variation and de novo mutations. On a macroevolutionary scale, H 2 S tolerance in 10 independent lineages of sulfide spring fishes across multiple genera of Poeciliidae is correlated with the convergent modification and expression changes in genes associated with H 2 S toxicity and detoxification. Our results demonstrate that the modification of highly conserved physiological pathways associated with essential mitochondrial processes mediates tolerance to physiochemical stress. In addition, the same pathways, genes, and—in some instances—codons are implicated in H 2 S adaptation in lineages that span 40 million years of evolution.},

	abstract = {Background: Chromatin dysregulation is associated with developmental disorders and cancer. Numerous methods for measuring genome-wide chromatin accessibility have been developed in the genomic era to interrogate the function of chromatin regulators. A recent technique which has gained widespread use due to speed and low input requirements with native chromatin is the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin, or ATAC-seq. Biologists have since used this method to compare chromatin accessibility between two cellular conditions. However, approaches for calculating differential accessibility can yield conflicting results, and little emphasis is placed on choice of normalization method during differential ATAC-seq analysis, especially when global chromatin alterations might be expected. Results: Using an in vivo ATAC-seq data set generated in our recent report, we observed differences in chromatin accessibility patterns depending on the data normalization method used to calculate differential accessibility. This observation was further verified on published ATAC-seq data from yeast. We propose a generalized workflow for differential accessibility analysis using ATAC-seq data. We further show this workflow identifies sites of differential chromatin accessibility that correlate with gene expression and is sensitive to differential analysis using negative controls. Conclusions: We argue that researchers should systematically compare multiple normalization methods before continuing with differential accessibility analysis. ATAC-seq users should be aware of the interpretations of potential bias within experimental data and the assumptions of the normalization method implemented.},
