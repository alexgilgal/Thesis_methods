\chapter{Objectives}

During the Introduction, we reviewed several concepts and ideas that have motivated the present research work. The research goals of this thesis are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item To identify regulatory changes that have occurred during the chordate-to-vertebrate transition. To understand what is the influence of conserved developmental signalling pathways in gene regulation and the emergence of evolutionary novelties.
    \item To understand the role of WGDs in the chordate-to-vertebrate transition and how these genome duplications influenced the appearance of novel tissues in vertebrates.
    \item To decipher the role of gene regulation in the adaptation to a new environment at microevolutionary scales, using \textit{Astyanax mexicanus} as a model organism.
    \item To discern between gene regulation and other mechanisms that may be influencing the adaptation to new environments at short periods of time.
\end{enumerate}
