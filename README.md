# Thesis methods

The main goal of this repository is to show the persons that read my PhD dissertation how the computational analyses were done. The scripts have commented code inside them, so everyone can follow what the scripts are doing. Also, the Materials and Methods section explains what every script does.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and your requirements for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires an external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
